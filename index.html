                        <h3>Why does this site attack my religion? </h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            I examine and critique religions because I care deeply about what is true and what is not true, and determining that requires investigation. If a religion is true, I would like to know, and live a life devoted to that religion. If a religion is false, out of concern for others, and out of respect for myself, I feel compelled to share why I have concluded that it is false, and should not be the foundation for a person's life. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>You must hate religious people!</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            If you are a religious person, I can say honestly that my default is to love you, and seek to engage reasonably, patiently, and earnestly with you. My default attitude toward sincere religious people is absolutely not anything like "hatred". 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            I was at one point in my life extremely religious, and I viewed my religion as more important than my family, friends, and my own life. I understand how deeply held religious beliefs can be, and empathize with sincere people who hold them. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>The articles addressing my religion are all nonsense! What a waste of time!</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            I assure you, they are not, and I have heard this kind of response many, many times over the years of running this site, typically because someone will see the volume and depth of the articles critiquing their religion, feel somewhat overwhelmed, and then seek to find a way to dismiss them all as soon as possible in one fell swoop. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            If you engage with my articles' content directly and specifically, I will be more than happy to <a href="about-contact/about-contact.html" target="_blank">engage with you</a>. If you want to message me to tell me how "dumb" articles that you may have only skimmed are, know that I am unimpressed, and that such a response doesn't work on me. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>What were your beliefs as a Christian?</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            I was raised Roman Catholic by my parents. I left Roman Catholicism for Evangelical Christianity when I was 16 years old, because I was persuaded that Evangelical Christianity was closer to what the Bible taught than Roman Catholicism. Specifically, I was a Free Grace Christian, which was my best attempt to reconcile the Bible's (very confusing, practically irreconcilable) soteriology. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            I became a Unitarian when I was 25 years old, and remained socially and theologically rather conservative. It was during this time that I created the website <a href="https://unitarianism.net/" target="_blank">unitarianism.net</a>. I still do not believe that the Bible as a book teaches the Deity of Christ, or anything similar to a Trinitarian view, and that modern Trinitarian Christians would be denounced by their god, Jesus, if they had met him in the first century. I believe in this sense, stated very plainly, that Trinitarian Christians, and all who hold to the Deity of Christ, are idolaters who have made a god out of a confused man who was unfortunately a false prophet, Jesus of Nazareth, mostly based on a misunderstanding of "John's" (<a href="topical-articles/articles/christianity/johns-jesus.html" target="_blank">fraudulent</a>) writings.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            I left Christianity when I was 26 years old, for many reasons, some of which are covered in <a href="topical-articles/articles/placeholder/8-31-25.html" target="_blank">this article</a>. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>What is your name?</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            My name is Noah Samuel Zielke. I don't post it everywhere because most people don't care what my name is, and I prefer to keep the focus on the actual content of my articles/videos rather than myself. 
                        </p>
