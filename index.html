                            The purpose of God giving the Law (including the Ten Commandments) in the Old Testament was to show mankind their need for a savior: 
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>

                            No one has ever kept the Law, or come anywhere close to keeping it (Romans 3:10-12, Psalm 14:2-3, Ecclesiastes 7:20):
                        </p>

                            As a result, no one can be justified before God by keeping the Law:

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Keeping the Law requires avoiding any sin, as the Bible says, "sin is the transgression of the Law" (1 John 3:4). Keeping the Law also requires one to behave perfectly towards God and others (Matthew 22:37-40). Therefore, because all of these things are contained in the Law, one cannot get to Heaven by being a good person, or by avoiding being a bad person, since no one is justified by the Law in God's sight.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Jesus Christ, who was <a href="/topical-articles/articles/jesus-old-testament/the-old-testament-is-the-most-compelling-reason-to-be-christian.html" target="_blank">prophesied to come for thousands of years</a> in the Old Testament, kept the entire Law perfectly, even though He allowed Himself to be tempted in a human body. In doing this, He fulfilled the Law (Matthew 5:17, Galatians 3:13). 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Jesus Christ's Atonement for Sinners</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Because Jesus was sinless, He was able to bear the sins of humanity. His substitutionary death, to redeem mankind, was the principle purpose in Him coming to earth (Hebrews 2:9).
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            On the cross, Jesus bore the sins of mankind in our place, as prophesied in the Old Testament (Isaiah 53:5-12):

                                24 Who <b>his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,</b> that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.

                            After three days, as prophesied in the Old Testament (Jonah 1:17, Matthew 12:40), Jesus rose from the dead, demonstrating that the payment for sins was complete. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Jesus Christ's payment for sin is the only payment acceptable by God to meet one's debt to the Law:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>

                                22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and <b>without shedding of blood is no remission.</b>

                            The basis for a person's justification before God can only be that payment - not one's own personal righteousness. That is why none can be justified by keeping the Law. Good works do not atone for sin, only Jesus Christ's payment atones for sin.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Accepting Jesus Christ's Payment for Sin</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In order to have Jesus Christ's payment for sin apply to one personally, God simply requires that they stop trusting in their own righteousness to justify themselves, and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone to save them from the penalty for their sins:
                        </p>

                        <p class="article-body">
                            When the Bible says "saved" here, it is referring to being saved from the punishment that a person has incurred for their sins; saved from Hell (Matthew 1:21, John 3:17). And, what does one have to do to be saved? Put their faith in Jesus Christ, instead of themselves. It is a simple transfer of trust.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Any of a person's own good works are explicitly excluded as the basis for Salvation (Titus 3:5). This is why the atonement that Jesus Christ provides is described as a "gift" (Romans 5:15-18, 6:23, John 4:10):
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Ephesians 2:8-9 </h5>

                                8 For by grace are ye <b>saved through faith;</b> and that not of yourselves: <b>it is the gift of God:</b> <br>
                                9 <b>Not of works,</b> lest any man should boast.

                            This is important, because it demonstrates that all of a person's faith has to be in Jesus Christ. Salvation from Hell is not a cooperative effort between a person and Jesus. Believers are saved by the grace of God, to the exclusion of their own works:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Romans 11:6</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                6 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
                            </p>

                        <p class="article-body">
                            As can be seen above, Salvation is truly free, because its given by grace.

                            Someone putting their faith in Jesus Christ as their Savior ensures that they will go to Heaven when they die, and that they will never come into eternal condemnation before God:

                            There are many passages of Scripture which teach the Eternal Security of the believer (John 6:39-40, 10:28-29, Romans 8:38-39, Ephesians 1:12-14: 1 John 5:13). The new birth that takes place when someone believes in Jesus (1 John 5:1, John 1:12, Galatians 3:26) secures for them a place in God's kingdom.

                            Very often, people who learn about the freeness of Salvation ask about whether the fact that believers are guaranteed to go to Heaven when they die means that it is permissible for them to do evil things without consequence. Nowhere does the Bible teach that a believer should do evil things simply because Salvation is free.

                            The first motivation for a believer to live righteously is to secure the blessing of God on their lives (Psalm 1:1-3, Proverbs 3:1-10), and also to avoid God's chastening here on this earth:

                        <blockquote>

                                6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.

                            A believer is a child of God (John 1:12, Galatians 3:26), and so God, as their Father, will discipline them if they misbehave, here on earth. There are many things that can happen to a sinning Christian in Scripture, including sickness and death (1 Corinthians 11:30-32), but going to Hell is <i>never</i> one of them.

                            The second motivation given to a Christian to live righteously is the fact that they will earn or lose eternal rewards in the coming kingdom of God based on how they live on earth:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>

                                11 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. <br>
                                12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; <br>
                                13 Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. <br>
                                14 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a <b>reward</b>. <br>
                                15 If any man's work shall be burned, <b> he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved;</b> yet so as by fire.

                            A Christian will be rewarded for the good things that they do. Notice that even if all of the Christian's works are burned up, they are still saved (verse 15).

                            In short, believers behave after Salvation to please the Lord who loved them enough to die for them, to show their love for those who God has blessed them to be able to influence, to secure God's blessing on their lives, to avoid God's temporal punishments here on earth, and to earn eternal rewards in the coming kingdom of God. If a person cares about their position in the future kingdom, they have every motivation to obey the future King, Jesus Christ, and His God, even if them going to Hell is not at stake.
