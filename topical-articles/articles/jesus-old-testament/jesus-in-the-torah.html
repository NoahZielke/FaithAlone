                                    7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. <br>
                                    21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.

                                After Adam and Eve fell, they made fig leaf aprons to cover their nakedness. God replaces this covering with coats of animal skins.
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                God replaced the aprons, because they were representative of Adam and Eve's attempt to cover their sin with their own works. The animal skins are the first appearance of the ubiquitous principal of blood atonement that God establishes in Scripture (Leviticus 17:11, Hebrews 9:22), ultimately culminating with the substitutionary death of Jesus Christ.

                                    14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: <br>
                                    15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

                                Verse 15 above is called the "Protoevangelium", meaning "The first Gospel". This is because it contains the first reference to the Messiah in the Bible - the promised seed of the woman who will "bruise the head of the serpent", who is Satan (Revelation 12:9, 20:2).
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                This is a reference to the death of Jesus Christ - in which the Devil "bruised His heel" - and resurrection, in which He undid the process of death which began here in the Garden of Eden, with the Devil (Hebrews 2:14: 1 John 3:8: 1 Corinthians 15:20-28, 54-57). One day, this will be more completely realized, with the final destruction of the Devil (Ezekiel 28:13-19, Revelation 20:10), and death itself, forever (Revelation 21:4).

                                <p class="mb-1">
                                    3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord. <br>
                                    4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering: <br>
                                    5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

                            <p class="article-body">
                                The account of Cain and Abel's offering is another pre-Mosaic testimony to the principle of blood atonement (Leviticus 17:11, Hebrews 9:22). There is indication that God communicated the requirement of sacrifice to the patriarchs even before the Law was given, as Noah (Genesis 7:2, 8:20-21) and Abraham (Genesis 22:2-13) perform sacrifices, and also Isaac (Genesis 26:25) and Jacob (Genesis 33:20, 35:1-7) build altars, ostensibly for sacrifices as well.  
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                In this account, Abel was accepted before God on the basis of the blood of the lamb that he sacrificed. The crops that Cain had cultivated, just as the fig leaf aprons which his parents made, were representative of mankind attempting to merit justification through their own effort, and so he was rejected by God.

                                <p class="mb-1">
                                    18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. <br>
                                    19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth: <br>
                                    20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

                            <p class="article-body">
                                Abraham's encounter with Melchizedek is strange for a number of reasons. Unlike nearly every other important figure, no indication is given of Melchizedek's origins. He just appears in the narrative, "the priest of the most high God".
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Firstly, it is said that he is the "King of Salem", noting the shared root with "Jeru-salem", which is both the capital of physical Israel in the Old Testament, as well as the name God chooses for His eternal city (Revelation 21:2). 
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                The word "Salem" means "peace" (Hebrews 7:2), and in Isaiah 9:6, it is prophesied that there will be a child born who is called "Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, <i>The Prince of Peace</i>", who will rule from the throne of David forever and ever (Isaiah 9:7). It was Jesus who secured peace and reconciliation between God and mankind (Romans 5:1, Ephesians 2:14, Colossians 1:20).
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Secondly, notice that Melchizedek "brought forth bread and wine", the two symbols that Jesus used as reference to His body and blood repeatedly (John 6:32-58, Matthew 26:26-29, etc.).
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Thirdly, in Psalm 110, which is a Messianic Psalm that prophesies of Jesus Christ, according to Himself (Matthew 22:41-45, Mark 12:35-37, Luke 20:41-44), it is said that Jesus Christ, "the Lord" of David (Psalm 110:1), is "a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek" (Psalm 110:4). 
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                This is reiterated and confirmed repeatedly in the book of Hebrews, which calls Jesus Christ "a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec" many times (Hebrews 5:6, 5:10, 6:20, 7:17, 7:21).
                            </p>

                                All of this is brought together in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%207&version=KJV" target="_blank">Hebrews chapter 7</a> in a powerful way, in which it is said that Melchizedek was greater that Abraham (Hebrews 7:6-7), and that since he was not in the line of Levi, he represented an older, everlasting priesthood (Hebrews 7:11, 7:24):
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>

                                    1 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; <br>
                                    2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; <br>
                                    3 Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually. <br>
                                    4 Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. <br>
                                    5 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: <br>
                                    6 But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. <br>
                                    7 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better. <br>
                                    8 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. <br>
                                    9 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham. <br>
                                    10 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him. <br>
                                    11 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?

                                Therefore, Melchizedek pictured Jesus in a number of significant ways, most notably the non-Levitical priesthood that He would establish.

                                    1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. <br>
                                    2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. <br>
                                    3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. <br>
                                    4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. <br>
                                    5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. <br>
                                    6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. <br>
                                    7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? <br>
                                    8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together. <br>
                                    9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. <br>
                                    10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. <br>
                                    11 And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. <br>
                                    12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. <br>
                                    13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.

                                The account of Abraham offering Isaac is one of the clearest pictures of Jesus Christ in the Old Testament.
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Firstly, note that three times in this chapter, when speaking to Abraham, God calls Isaac "thine only son Isaac" (Genesis 22:2, 22:12, 22:16). This is significant, because Abraham already had a son named Ishmael. Yet, Ishmael is cast out, and not counted for his seed (Genesis 17:19-21, 21:10-12, Romans 9:7, Hebrews 11:17-18). Ishmael, born of Hagar the bondwoman, was to be representative of the Old Covenant, and God chose Isaac, born of Sarah the free woman, to symbolize the New Covenant (Galatians 4:22-31). And, God telling Abraham to specifically offer his "only son", is symbolic of the fact that "God so loved the world, that <i>he gave his only begotten Son,</i> that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16). 
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Secondly, it is said in the New Testament that Abraham knew that if God had allowed him to sacrifice Isaac, that He would raise Isaac from the dead, and that this would be a figure of what was to come (Hebrews 11:19). This is evidenced in the Genesis account, where Abraham, knowing what he was about to have to do, still tells his servants that he <i>and Isaac</i> will be returning from the mountain (Genesis 22:5).
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Thirdly, Abraham takes the wood, and lays it upon Isaac (Genesis 22:6) before they go up the mountain, just as Christ had to carry His cross to Calvary (John 19:17). 
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Fourthly, in verse 13, Isaac's place is taken by an innocent substitute - a ram "caught in a thicket by his horns". This also pictures Jesus Christ, who had branches from thorn bushes wrapped around His head to form a mock crown (Matthew 27:29, Mark 15:17, John 19:2). 
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Fifthly, Abraham says "God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering" (Genesis 22:8), even though what God later gave them in place of Isaac was a <i>ram</i>. They are not the same animal, and a different Hebrew word is used. This is prophetic of Jesus Christ, whom John the Baptist - who was also prophesied in the Old Testament (Malachi 3:1, Exodus 23:20, Isaiah 40:3-5, Matthew 3:3, 11:10, Mark 1:2-3, Luke 3:4-6, 7:27, John 1:22-23) - called the "Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29, 1:35-36), at the very beginning of His ministry.

                            <h4 class="pt-1">The Life of Joseph</h4>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Joseph, one of the sons of Israel, and the main character of Genesis chapters 37-50, has a life that is noted for having a large amount of parallels to Jesus Christ:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="font-size:large">
                                <li>Joseph's birth was miraculous (Genesis 30:22-24), just like Jesus's virgin birth was miraculous (Matthew 1:20)</li>
                                <li>Joseph was a shepherd (Genesis 37:2). Jesus called Himself the "good shepherd" (John 10:11), and used "sheep" as a symbol for believers, with the "shepherd" representing Himself, repeatedly in His preaching</li>
                                <li>Joseph was explicitly sent by his father to seek his brethren (Genesis 37:13-16), and said "I seek my brethren" (Genesis 37:16), just like Jesus was sent by God the Father (John 8:42) to seek his brethren (Matthew 15:24)</li>
                                <li>Joseph was betrayed by his brothers whom he was sent to (Genesis 37:20-32). Jesus was not believed on by His brothers (John 7:5), and was rejected by His "brethren" the Jews (John 1:11) <!--Matthew 27:20-26, Mark 15:8-15, Luke 23:20-25, John 19:15, etc.--> </li>
                                <li>Joseph's brothers take his coat (Genesis 37:23), and dip his coat in blood (Genesis 37:31), just like Christ was stripped before His crucifixion (Matthew 27:35), and will return "clothed with a vesture dipped in blood" (Revelation 19:13) </li>
                                <li>Joseph was cast into a pit, of which it is said "the pit was empty, there was no water in it" (Genesis 37:24). This signifies Jesus being buried in an empty tomb (Matthew 27:59-60) </li>
                                <li>Joseph's brother <i>Judah</i> was the one that proposed that they sell Joseph (Genesis 37:26-27). "Judas", which is the same name as "Judah" in the Greek language (Matthew 1:2), is the one who sold and betrayed Jesus (Matthew 26:14-16)</li>
                                <li>Joseph was sold for 20 pieces of silver (Genesis 37:28), the price of a young man under the Law (Leviticus 27:5). Jesus was betrayed for 30 pieces of silver (Matthew 26:14-16), which was the price of a servant who was killed under the Law (Exodus 21:32). Jesus's price should have been 50 pieces under the Law (Leviticus 27:3), an insult that God notes sarcastically through the prophet Zechariah - "So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver... a goodly price that I was priced at of them" (Zechariah 11:12-13, referenced in Matthew 27:3-10)</li>
                                <li>Joseph is taken to Egypt (Genesis 37:28), just like young Jesus was taken to Egypt (Matthew 2:13-15)</li>
                                <li>Reuben comes back and is surprised to find the pit where they had put Joseph empty (Genesis 37:29), paralleling the empty tomb after the Resurrection (Luke 24:2-3, etc.)</li>
                                <li>Joseph is falsely accused and arrested (Genesis 39:11-20), just as Jesus was falsely accused and arrested (Matthew 26:47-56) </li>
                                <li>Joseph is then punished with two prisoners (Genesis 40:1-4), one of which lives, and the other is executed (Genesis 40:20-22). Jesus was crucified alongside two thieves (Luke 23:32-33), one of which believes, and the other does not (Luke 23:39-43)</li>
                                <li>The prisoners with Joseph have prophetic dreams involving bread and wine (Genesis 40:8-19), the same symbolism that Christ consistently used throughout the New Testament (John 6:32-58, Matthew 26:26-29, etc.)</li>
                                <li>Joseph starts his service to Pharaoh at thirty years old (Genesis 41:46). Jesus began His ministry being "about thirty years of age" (Luke 3:23)</li>
                                <li>Joseph says to his brethren, "God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance" (Genesis 45:7), just as the Bible says "the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world" (1 John 4:14). Joseph pictured, with physical salvation, the Salvation from sins that Jesus would bring (Matthew 1:21)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                A lot of the events in Joseph's life, which would have seemed incidental at the time, found their fulfillment in Jesus Christ.

                                    1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days. <br>
                                    8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee. <br>
                                    9 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? <br>
                                    10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be. <br>
                                    11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes: <br>
                                    12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.

                                In context, Jacob is nearing the end of his life, and he gathers his children together to tell them things "which shall befall them in the last days", obviously, indicating that there is prophecy being given, which may extend far into the future.
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Judah is particularly important, because Jesus Christ is "the lion of the tribe of Judah" (Revelation 5:5), something referenced in verse 9 above. Christ is descended from Judah on both sides of His family (Matthew 1:3, Luke 3:33).
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Verse 10 is the most significant verse in the prophecy. The word "Shiloh" is a reference to the Messiah, and this foretells that Judah will be established as the kingly tribe in Israel, up until Shiloh comes. This was fulfilled in David, a descendant of Judah, who became king about 800 years after this prophecy was given, and whose descendants ruled in Israel, Jerusalem, and Judea until <i>after</i> Christ came, being finally expelled in 70-135 AD. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                David himself also received promises from God that his descendants would have an everlasting throne, and never lack a king ruling in Israel (2 Samuel 7:16, Psalm 89:3-4, 89:28-37, 132:11, Jeremiah 33:17). Jesus Christ is also descended from David on both sides (Matthew 1:1, 1:6, Luke 3:31), and was the fulfillment of these promises. During His first advent, He emphasized His kingship over a heavenly kingdom (John 18:36-37), and in His second advent, He will rule as king from an earthly kingdom (Revelation 11:15, 19:15-16, 20:4-6).

                                First, note that Jesus is called the "Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world" by John the Baptist (John 1:29, 1:35-36), over three years before He died. Even before the events took place, God was pointing to the fact that Jesus was the fulfillment of the Passover, as well as Abraham's prophecy regarding the Lamb of God (Genesis 22:8), as discussed in the Genesis section of this article.
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Secondly, notice that the lamb was kept from the tenth day until the fourteenth day (Exodus 12:3, 12:6). This parallels Jesus's triumphal entry into Jerusalem ("presentation of the lamb") to His crucifixion 4 days later <i>during Passover week</i>, proving that He was the fulfillment of this picture that had been prophesying of Him for 1,500 years. Consequently, in the New Testament, Jesus Christ is called "our Passover" (1 Corinthians 5:7).
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Thirdly, the male lamb had to be spotless (Exodus 12:5), because it pictured Jesus Christ, who is sinless (2 Corinthians 5:21, Hebrews 4:15: 1 Peter 2:21-22: 1 John 3:5).
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Fourthly, notice that the lamb's blood had to be shed, and applied to the doorpost of the house (Exodus 12:7), which saved the people inside the house. Anyone, regardless of any other circumstances, who was in that house, would be "passed over" by the Lord when He was executing deadly judgement (Exodus 12:13).
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                This pictures Salvation by faith alone in the Lamb, because the shed blood of Jesus Christ saves us from our sin (Ephesians 1:7, Colossians 1:14, Revelation 1:5), and anyone who puts their faith in Jesus will not come into condemnation when God is executing judgement (John 5:24).
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Fifthly, none of the bones of the Passover lamb could be broken (Exodus 12:46), and the Bible is careful to mention that none of Jesus's bones were broken during His crucifixion (John 19:36), as also prophesied in Psalm 34:20.
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Sixthly, the original Passover was to save the Israelite's firstborn son. This is representative of the Salvation of the Church, as the Church is spiritual Israel (Galatians 6:16, Ephesians 2:11-13, 19), and "Israel is my firstborn son" (Exodus 4:22).

                                A person who rejects belief in Jesus has to puzzle over why the Jews did this specific tradition for over 1,500 years, before Jesus just happened to show up, and had His life culminate in the fulfillment of each detail of what they had been doing all that time, on the very date of the holiday itself.

                                    12 <b>Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</b> <br>
                                    13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: <br>
                                    14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? <br>
                                    15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. <br>
                                    16 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. <br>
                                    17 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. <br>

                                Just as the Old Covenant was dedicated with blood, so too is the New Covenant dedicated with blood. Therefore, the sacrificial, substitutionary death of the Messiah, completes yet another Old Testament picture, and ushered in the New Covenant - the coming of which had likewise been explicitly prophesied (Jeremiah 31:31-34, Hebrews 8:8-12).

                                    1 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect. <br>
                                    2 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins. <br>

                                As mentioned in the introduction to this book, a large part of Leviticus describes the sacrifices that were prescribed for the children of Israel in various circumstances. Therefore, the above passage is but one example that could have been chosen from Leviticus, which is exemplary of the symbolism of Christ in these sacrifices.

                                Notice that the lamb, just like the Passover lamb, had to be "a male without blemish" (Leviticus 1:10), because it was picturing the sinless Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 5:21, Hebrews 4:15: 1 Peter 2:21-22: 1 John 3:5).

                                The blood was "sprinkled round about upon the altar" (Leviticus 1:11), one of many testaments to the Biblical doctrine of blood atonement (Leviticus 17:11, Hebrews 9:22), which culminated in the atoning death of Christ.

                                Finally, the fact that it was a "burnt sacrifice" (Leviticus 1:13) symbolizes the wrath of God (Hebrews 12:29, Deuteronomy 32:22) being turned to Christ on the cross (Matthew 27:46, Mark 15:34).

                                Firstly, the person being anointed - the High Priest - represented Jesus Christ, as he was to be the sole mediator between the people and God on the Day of Atonement, which is covered at length in Leviticus chapter 16. Once per year, he would go into the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle (Leviticus 16:2-3), alone, and sprinkle the blood on the Mercy Seat of the Ark of the Covenant for the sins of the people (Leviticus 16:15-16).

                                    1 Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary. <br>
                                    2 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary. <br>
                                    3 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; <br>
                                    4 Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; <br>
                                    5 And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly. <br>
                                    6 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God. <br>
                                    7 <b>But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:</b> <br>
                                    8 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: <br>
                                    9 Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; <br>
                                    10 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation. <br>
                                    11 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; <br>
                                    12 <b>Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</b> <br>
                                    24 <b>For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:</b> <br>
                                    25 <b>Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;</b> <br>
                                    26 <b>For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</b> <br>
                                    27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: <br>
                                    28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.

                                Above, the way in which High Priest in the Old Covenant represented Jesus Christ is detailed, though of course, the picture wasn't a perfect match, as the High Priest had to make a sin offering for his own sins as well (Leviticus 16:6, 16:11, Hebrews 7:26-29), and do the procedure every year, whereas the work of Jesus Christ was perfect, and done only one time.
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                The fact that the office of High Priest in the Old Testament signified Christ's office is further solidified in Hebrews, where Christ is called our "High Priest" multiple times (Hebrews 2:17, 3:1, 4:14-15, 5:10, 6:20, 7:26-28, 8:1, 9:11, 10:21), often emphasizing the fact that this designates Him as our sole mediator with God the Father (1 Timothy 2:5).

                            <p class="article-body">
                                Then, the significance of the "anointing" of the High Priest itself is demonstrated when looking at the fact that "Christ", which is the same as "Messiah" (John 1:41), means "anointed" (compare Psalm 2:2 with Acts 4:26). So, in the Old Testament, the High Priest, Aaron, gets physically anointed with oil, as he is picturing God's anointed mediator.

                                Finally, in what is a very clear picture of Christ, it is decreed in the Old Covenant that the <i>death</i> of the High Priest had atoning, life-for-life symbolism. In Numbers 35:22-28, and Joshua 20:2-6, it is decreed that someone who had committed manslaughter was bound to the cities of refuge, until the death of the High Priest - a <i>very</i> peculiar law, without the symbolic meaning that that Christ's death would later bring it. In this, it was as if the avenger of blood had been satisfied by the death of the High Priest, in place of the one who did the manslaughter.

                                In Leviticus chapter 16, the Day of Atonement is described. It is written that there were to be two goats chosen, and one would be sacrificed, with its blood sprinkled on the Ark of the Covenant in the Tabernacle (Leviticus 16:11-19), with the other would be designated as the "scapegoat". 
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                The High Priest would put all of the sins of Israel on the goat (Leviticus 16:21), and then the goat would be taken deep into the wilderness by a fit man, and left there. This pointed to two aspects of the Lord Jesus Christ's work.
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                The first parallel is the fact that Jesus Christ, like the scapegoat, "bore our sins in his own body on the tree" (1 Peter 2:24). Similarly, the Bible says that God "hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin" (2 Corinthians 5:21), and "the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all" (Isaiah 53:6). So, just like the scapegoat, Jesus was "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29), because all of our sins were placed on Him.
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                The exiling of the goat into the wilderness symbolized the fact that "As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us" (Psalm 103:12). God uses distance/location elsewhere to emphasize that our sins are gone (Isaiah 38:17, Micah 7:19). It is on the basis of Jesus Christ's atonement that God promises believers, "their sins and iniquities will I remember no more" (Hebrews 8:12, 10:17, Jeremiah 31:34, Isaiah 43:25).
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Then, separately from the scapegoat, a sin offering was made (Leviticus 16:24-25), which once again was to be a testimony in front of all the people of the concept of blood atonement (Leviticus 17:11).
                            </p>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                And, recall that all of these Old Testament references ultimately looked toward the cross, because "it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins" (Hebrews 10:4), and God is a God that "will by no means clear the guilty" (Exodus 34:7, Numbers 14:18). Every time God forgave in the Old Testament, rather than being done by fiat, or capriciously, it was instead on the basis of Jesus Christ's atonement, which was decreed from the very beginning of creation, as He is the "Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" (Revelation 13:8).

                                In Leviticus chapter 23, God gives the calendar for the various feast days that were to be observed throughout the year. They are:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="font-size:large">

                                <li>Feast of Firstfruits - Sixteenth day of the first month (Leviticus 23:10-14)</li>
                                <li>Feast of Weeks (Pentecost) - 50 days after the Feast of Firstfruits (Leviticus 23:15-21)</li>
                                <li>Feast of Trumpets - First day of the seventh month (Leviticus 23:23-25) </li>
                                <li>Day of Atonement - Tenth day of the seventh month (Leviticus 16:1-34, 23:26-32)</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Year of Jubilees - Every 50 years, the Year of Jubilee would begin on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 25:1-55)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Feast of Tabernacles/Booths - Fifteenth day of the seventh month, lasting 7 days (Leviticus 23:33-43) </li>

                            <p class="article-body">
                                From the above, not counting the Sabbath which was year-round, and combining the Year of Jubilee with the Day of Atonement, two groups can be made - the Spring feasts, of which there are 4, and the Fall feasts, of which there are 3 - seven in total. 
                            </p>

                                The first group - the Spring feasts - are representative of Christ's first coming. The Fall feasts are representative of Christ's second coming. 
                            </p>
                            <h4>Passover</h4>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                Starting with the Passover, Christ was "our Passover" (1 Corinthians 5:7), was crucified during Passover week, and was the Passover "Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29, 1:35-36). The holiday of Passover is covered further in the section on Exodus 12:1-13 above, as well. 
                            </p>
                            <h4>Feast of Unleavened Bread</h4>
                            <p class="article-body">
                                The Feast of Unleavened Bread primarily pointed to the removal of the unbiblical Jewish customs that would come to be accepted by the Jews before Christ's coming. So, when Christ arrives, He says "Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees", which was their doctrine (Matthew 16:5-12, Mark 8:13-21), and hypocrisy (Luke 12:1). 
                            </p>

                                This holiday, along with Passover, is also referenced in the context of "leaven" representing evil generally:

                                    7 <b>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</b> <br>

                                Continuing with the Spring feasts, the Feast of Firstfruits was where the Jews were to bring a sheaf from their harvest to the priest, and celebrate that God had given them another year of harvest.

                                The "sheaf" in this case represented Jesus Christ, who was the first one to be raised from the dead in a glorified body - which is a token of the fact that all Christians will be raised from the dead in the same manner:

This was when the early church really began to grow, and began the age that we are in now, which also coincides with the fact that this is the final Spring holiday. The period, then, between Spring and Fall, represents this age that we are living in right now - in between the first and second advent of the Lord.

And, while I believe my interpretations of these feasts are reasonable, because they represent the future, I acknowledge that they certainly aren't infallible.

                                The first Fall feast is the Feast of Trumpets. Trumpets were often used to signify danger in the Old Testament (Jeremiah 42:14, Ezekiel 33:3-6, Amos 3:6, Zephaniah 1:16, etc.), and the children of Israel would later be told to make two special trumpets (Numbers 10:1-10), which they were to blow in times of great distress, and God would save them:

                                In summary, the feast days given in Leviticus are highly significant.

This time, he is told to speak to the rock.

                                    5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread. <br>
                                    6 And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died. <br>
                                    7 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. <br>
                                    8 And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. <br>
                                    9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.

                                Here, the people complain against God, and as punishment, God sends poisonous snakes amongst them. They entreat Moses, and he intercedes to God, who tells him to make a <i>very</i> unusual idol - a brass serpent on a pole.

                                The serpent is the best animal to represent sin, being the form that Satan took in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:1), and such is the form by which he is referenced, even 4,000 years later (Revelation 12:9, 20:2). It is for this reason that Jesus likened Himself to the serpent on the pole when He was crucified:

                                Jesus taking on the sins of the world completes this symbolism in a way that is undeniable, and turns what would've seemed like a puzzling story, of God essentially commissioning an idol, into an unambiguous prophecy of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

                            <p class="article-body">
                                Finally, notice that all those who merely <i>looked</i> at the serpent would be healed. Similarly, when discussing the symbol, Jesus says that all who believe in Him have Everlasting Life (John 3:15). Salvation by simple faith alone completes the symbol beautifully, and all works Salvation religions and denominations do not. They mar, and nullify, this crystal-clear symbol.

                                Firstly, he is set "over the congregation". The word "church" means "congregation" (Acts 7:38, etc.). And, Christ is frequently called the head of the Church (Colossians 1:18, 2:19, Ephesians 4:15-16, 5:23-24), for instance:

                                Secondly, in Numbers 27:17, Joshua is pictured as a shepherd, put over the congregation so that they are not "as sheep which have no shepherd". This parallel is emphasized by Jesus repeatedly in John 10:1-16, where He describes believers as "sheep", and famously calls Himself the "good shepherd" (John 10:11, 10:14). Beyond the passage in John chapter 10, Jesus is pictured as a shepherd repeatedly throughout the New Testament (Matthew 9:36, 26:31, Mark 6:34, 14:27, Hebrews 13:20: 1 Peter 2:25, 5:4).

                                Finally, the name "Joshua" is the Hebrew equivalent of the name "Jesus". "Jesus" is an English transliteration from Greek, and "Joshua" is an English transliteration of the Hebrew. Consequently, Joshua is referenced twice in the New Testament, and his name is rendered as "Jesus" in some translations (Acts 7:44-45, Hebrews 4:8).

                                Firstly, he would need to be a mediator between God and the people. Verses 16 and 17 in the passage in question reference the event where Moses spoke to God on the mountain on behalf of the people, because they had been terrified when they had heard God speaking (Exodus 20:18-19). God says of the prophet in the passage that "(I) will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him" (Deuteronomy 18:18).

                                Accordingly, is seen in Jesus Christ's preaching are repeated statements that He was not putting forth His own agenda, but rather on a mission from God the Father, delivering what God the Father told Him to say (John 5:30-32, 5:36-37, 5:43, 7:16-18, 8:42, 12:49-50).

                                So, just as Moses spoke with the Lord "face to face, as a man speaks unto his friend" (Exodus 33:11, Numbers 12:6-8), and then reiterated that message to the Israelites, Jesus Christ had a similarly unique access to God, and then He reiterated the message which He received from Him in His preaching.

                                Much later, after Jesus's death and resurrection, the fact that He was this prophet is confirmed by Stephen (Acts 7:37, 7:52), and also Peter, when preaching to the Jews:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>

                                    22 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. <br>
                                    23 And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. <br>
                                    24 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. <br>
                                    25 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. <br>
                                    26 Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.

                                Therefore, people were anticipating this "Prophet like unto Moses" during the time of Jesus Christ. He fulfilled the prophesied role of the prophet, in His work of mediation, and His abundant miracles. And, Jews accepted Him as the prophet, and used these facts to preach to other Jews.
