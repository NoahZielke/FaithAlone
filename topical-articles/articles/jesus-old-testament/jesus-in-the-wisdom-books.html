Job also lived to be around 200 years old (Job 42:16), which is consistent with the lifespans around the time of Abraham's parents (Genesis 11:32). It tells the story of one man, who is put through a formidable trial by God.</li>

                            The famous words of Job above demonstrate that he had an awareness of his own need for redemption (despite being a very righteous person, Job 1:8), as well as God's provision for redemption. He says of his redeemer that "he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth", which refers to Jesus Christ, our Redeemer (Galatians 3:13: 1 Peter 1:18-19).

                            Above is the entirety of Psalm 2, which is entirely Messianic.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Firstly, the subject is the Lord's "anointed" (verse 2). The terms "Messiah" and "Christ" are Biblically equivalent (John 1:41), and they both mean "chosen" or "anointed", so that when the above is quoted in the New Testament, the word "Christ" is used:

                            Secondly, the entire Psalm is in context to the Messiah ruling "the uttermost parts of the earth" (verse 8) - which includes all the Gentile nations. This is something that the speaker, David, never did, and no king in Israel has ever done.

                            This Messianic reign of Jesus will take place after His second advent, and is spoken of in the book of Revelation:

                            These descriptions of Christ's reign from the book of Revelation match the Psalms references to the Messiah ruling the "kings of the earth" (verses 2, 10), and the "heathen" (verse 8). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Finally, the identification of the Messiah as the Son of God in verses 7 and 12 - "Thou art my Son", and "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him". 
                        </p>

                            Notice that the Son would be a ruler, and one to put one's trust in. Every last detail finds its fulfillment in the "Son of God", Jesus Christ (Mark 1:1, John 10:36, etc.), who unashamedly made it clear that if anyone fails to put their trust in Him, they will incur wrath and condemnation (John 3:18, 3:36).

                                25 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved: <br>
                                26 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: <br>
                                27 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. <br>

                                30 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; <br>
                                31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. <br>

However, the Jesus Christ's body didn't decay, because He rose bodily from the dead, and therefore, He is the "Holy One" that David was prophesying of in this Messianic Psalm.

                                5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded. <br>
                                6 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people. <br>

                                10 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly. <br>

                                15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. <br>
                                16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet. <br>
                                17 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me. <br>

                                20 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog. <br>
                                21 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns. <br>

                            Above is the entirety of Psalm 22. Jesus Christ famously called attention to this Psalm on the cross, saying "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46, Mark 15:34). On the cross, Jesus was pointing to this Psalm, and any who have read it find it to be describing exactly what was happening to Jesus Christ, at that moment.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Verses 1-5 of this Psalm serve as a kind of preamble. Verse 6 begins from the perspective of Jesus Christ, hanging on the cross. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In this section, which comprises verses 6-21, Christ is surrounded by "bulls" (verse 12), "lions" (verses 13, 21), and "dogs" (verses 16, 20) - symbolic of the assembly gathered there to crucify Him, and watch the crucifixion. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Of them, Jesus says that "All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him" (verses 7-8). This matches Jesus Christ's experience on the cross exactly. The spectators of His execution were not respectful, or timid. They railed on Him repeatedly (Matthew 27:39-44, Mark 15:29-32, Luke 23:35-39), and verse 8 is a verbatim quotation of the chief priests who were present at the crucifixion:
                        </p>

                                41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, <br>
                                42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. <br>
                                43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.

                            Continuing in the Psalm, Christ says that "They pierced my hands and my feet" (verse 16), which is descriptive of crucifixion in such a clear, obvious way, that it needs no explanation. Those present also "part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture" (verse 18), fulfilled to the last detail in John 19:23-24, and also mentioned in Matthew 27:35, and Luke 23:34.

Here, the "God" is the King Messiah, Jesus Christ, who is anointed and exalted by God, to the glory of God (Philippians 2:5-11).

                            The fulfillment of this promise in Christ makes sense, as there have been no kings in Israel from David, ruling over even only Jerusalem, for many hundreds of years. God's expulsion of the Jews in 70 AD pointed to the everlasting kingship given to Jesus Christ, and His children, which is the fulfillment of this promise to David.

                            Above, Jesus is teaching through rhetoric that the Messiah would be far greater than David - the Son of God. He is the son of David, but He is, more importantly, the Lord of David, as David himself testified in this Psalm.

                            This Psalm also mentions the priesthood of Melchizedek. Jesus Christ, who like David, was from the tribe of Judah, was not to be part of the Levitical priesthood. Instead, He was to be the High Priest of an everlasting priesthood, after the order of Melchizedek, something described in Hebrews chapter 7, and discussed at length in <a href="../jesus-old-testament/jesus-in-the-torah.html" target="_blank">Jesus in the Torah</a>, under the section covering Genesis 14:18:

                                14 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood. <br>
                                15 And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest, <br>
                                16 Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life. <br>
                                17 For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. <br>
                                18 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. <br>
                                19 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God. <br>
                                20 And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest: <br>
                                21 (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:) <br>

                            Above, the symbolism of a cornerstone is used to represent something of chief importance. In this Psalm, a stone that was <i>rejected</i> becomes the cornerstone of the entire building, because of the salvation of God.

                            The second part of the final question - "And what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?", <i>assumes</i> that one already understands the answer to the other questions. So, the reader is being asked about the name of the Son of God.

                            This is teaching through rhetoric that God has a Son, and specifically, we are being asked to consider <i>a</i> Son, singular. Having the benefit of hindsight with respect to the virgin birth, and Jesus's frequent identification as "The Son of God" (Mark 1:1, John 10:36, etc.), we know the answer to the riddle. Though many are called the sons of God in Scripture, Christ is the "only begotten" Son of God (1 John 4:9, John 3:16), and therefore, the only candidate for who is being asked about here.
