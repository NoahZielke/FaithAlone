                                <i>1. Messianic prophecies are not clearly identified as such.</i> <br>
                                
                                There is not a single verse in the entire Hebrew Bible that is specifically identified as a Messianic prophecy. Nowhere do the Scriptures say, "The next paragraph contains a prediction of the Messiah!" Thus, whether or not one accepts a certain passage as Messianic depends largely on how one understands the person and work of the Messiah. <br><br>
                                
                                For example, if someone believes that the Messiah will be a king who will bring peace to the earth, he will probably interpret Isaiah 11 as a Messianic prophecy. But he will not interpret Isaiah 53 in a Messianic way because it does not fit his preconceived notion of what the Messiah will do. And so, when we point to Isaiah 53, he will confidently say to us, "But that is not a Messianic prophecy!"  <br><br>
                                
                                How can we answer his argument? Just ask a simple question: "Who says Isaiah 53 is not Messianic while Isaiah 11 is Messianic? Who says your interpretation is right?" In other words, help him to see that his understanding of Messianic prophecy is based on traditional bias as opposed to objective scriptural truth.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Non-Christians sometimes make the claim that the Jews before the time of Jesus did not view these passages Messianically, that is, as having to do with the Messiah. In reality, there is very little, if any, Jewish commentary from before the time of Jesus, or contemporaneous with Jesus, that exists today, meaning that at the very least, the one making such a claim is almost certainly overstating their case. It is not as if there are volumes of Jewish Midrash from the time of Jesus, commenting on all of these passages of Scripture, which one can go to and reference to see what Jews of the time thought of them.

                            However, from some of the earliest Jewish commentary on Scripture found in the Talmud and other early sources, up to the Medieval period in the writings of famous Jewish commentators like Rashi (1040-1105 AD) and Radak (1160-1235 AD), there are Messianic interpretations of the passages that the New Testament cites in reference to Jesus Christ:

                                2 Apropos the eulogy at the end of days, the Gemara asks: For what is the nature of this eulogy? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Dosa and the Rabbis disagree concerning this matter. One said that this eulogy is for Messiah ben Yosef who was killed in the war of Gog from the land of Magog prior to the ultimate redemption with the coming of Messiah ben David. And one said that this eulogy is for the evil inclination that was killed. The Gemara asks: Granted, according to the one who said that the lament is for Messiah ben Yosef who was killed, this would be the meaning of that which is written in that context: "And they shall look unto Me because they have thrust him through; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son" (Zechariah 12:10).

                                11 Do not read the word as shamot, rather as shemot, names. The names given to people are, therefore, "the works of the Lord upon the earth." And Rabbi Yoḥanan said other aggadic statements in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: The existence of wayward children in a person's home is more troublesome than the war of Gog and Magog, the ultimate war, the climax of the travails of Messianic times. As it is stated: "A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son, Absalom" (Psalms 3:1). And it is written thereafter: "Lord, how numerous are my enemies, many have risen against me" (Psalms 3:2). While concerning the war of Gog and Magog, which is alluded to in the second chapter of Psalms, it is written: "Why are the nations in an uproar? And why do the peoples speak for naught? The kings of the earth stand up and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against His anointed... He that sits in heaven laughs, the Lord mocks them" (Psalms 2:1-4). Yet in this chapter describing the war of Gog and Magog "how numerous are my enemies" is not written, as it is not as difficult as raising a wayward son like Absalom.

                            Additionally, some of the passages in which Jesus fulfilled a symbol or type in the Old Testament cannot really be "debunked" or "disproven". The most one can say is that they do not find the parallels to be compelling. For example, if one rejects the Christian assertion that the holiday of Passover, instituted in Exodus 12, was symbolic of Jesus Christ, who is called the "Lamb of God" (John 1:29<!-- John 1:36, Revelation 5:6, 7:17, 19:9-->), and who was crucified on the holiday of Passover, then they can say that they are not compelled by whatever parallels may exist. However, they cannot "refute" that it is a symbol of Jesus Christ, because there is no possible logical way to eliminate the possibility that it could be symbolic of Jesus.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            As Christians, we believe that the New Testament usage of the Old Testament is divinely inspired, and view its Old Testament references - whether obvious or non-obvious - as legitimate on that basis. And, it certainly seems that a fair reader can find striking parallels to Jesus Christ in many of the Old Testament passages cited of Him by the New Testament authors, even without commentary.
