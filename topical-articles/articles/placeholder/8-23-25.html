                            I have doubts about the truthfulness of Christianity. This is difficult for me, because my Christian faith was very precious to me for basically my entire life. But, I think there has been a shift from "accept Christianity, in spite of difficulties" to "do not believe, because of difficulties", for me personally.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Firstly, Jesus saying that He would return within the lifespan of the audiences listening to him, once I examined all the verses together (Matthew 10:23, 16:27-28, 24:3-34), and took a consistent meaning of "this generation" in Matthew, where it means "this generation" of people currently living (Matthew 11:16, 12:41-42, 12:45, 17:17, 23:36), was a major break for me. Accepting that God, without explicitly saying so, "delayed Jesus's second coming", in spite of what Jesus said (and especially how he said it), is really difficult. The way that the writers of the New Testament speak of Jesus's return also indicates that they thought it would be very soon (Romans 13:11-12, 16:20: 1 Corinthians 7:29, 10:11: Philippians 4:5: 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17, Hebrews 9:26, 10:37, James 5:7-8: 1 Peter 4:7 Revelation 1:1, 1:3, 22:6). The only book that appears to deal with it not taking place is 2 Peter, which has an absurd amount of controversy surrounding it (rejected early, apparently quotes Jude, very different from 1 Peter).
                        </p>
                        <!-- <p class="article-body">
                            Secondly, the Old Testament has certain issues which are, in my opinion, disqualifying. For instance, the book of Daniel records king Nebuchadnezzar acknowledging the supremacy of the God of the Jews in chapter 4, after a period of 7 years of madness. There is no non-Biblical source that mentions or suggests anything like this occurring at all. And, if he had converted, one would expect that to have some effect on the Jewish Babylonian captivity, which he himself caused. However, there is a later Babylonian king named Nabonidus, who was the father of Belshazzar (interestingly, Daniel says that Nebuchadnezzar was the father of Belshazzar [Daniel 5:2, 5:11, 5:18, 5:22]), and a document from the Dead Sea Scrolls called the "Prayer of Nabonidus" describes him going mad for 7 years, and then being healed by the most high God of the Jews. So, it appears Daniel conflated Nebuchadnezzar with Nabonidus, or repurposed this legend and applied it to Nebuchadnezzar (a much more famous king). I would encourage anyone reading this to simply read the Prayer of Nabonidus, then read Daniel chapter 4, and see for themselves, also considering the unlikelihood that Nebuchadnezzar publicly acknowledged the supremacy of the God of the Jews after going mad for 7 years, and then wrote a public conversion decree for his whole empire which apparently quotes Psalm 145:13 (Daniel 4:3, 4:34, compare Daniel 7:14, 7:27), Isaiah 40:17 (Daniel 4:35), and Job 9:12 (Daniel 4:35). There are other major historical issues with the Old Testament, but this is one example from an already extremely controversial book, the book of Daniel.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Additionally, the nature of Scripture is a big problem for me. Why should I believe, for instance, that the epistle of Jude was inspired by the God of the universe? Or that God sanctioned what was written in the book of Hebrews, or James? Or that those who took it upon themselves to write Gospels actually had all the facts concerning Jesus, and represented him accurately? And where they disagree, which of them was more accurate to what Jesus originally said, or did, or what happened? Who are these men? Are they reliable? Are the honest? Are they intelligent? They did not claim a divine commission for writing. So, why should I believe that their writings are protected from error in any sense? Their works being very well-written, or quoting Old Testament scripture, or agreeing with other works in the corpus, or being attached to those who allegedly knew Jesus in some way, does not mean that the God of the universe protected them from error in some way while they wrote. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Consider also the position that since Jesus was the Christ, commissioned with a message from God, we must listen to everything that he taught. I cannot actually do that. I cannot speak to Jesus. There is nothing written by him. And, there is no way to read what he said, without first putting one's faith in human beings, and supposing that their representation of him is accurate. This is putting faith in men, not Jesus, and not God, because the best I can do is believe the witness of men other than Jesus, that he actually said what they present as being said by him. Additionally, I have to rely on the witness of men who copied these writings, and translated them. This is squarely putting one's faith in men. God never promised to me that He would inspire these writings, or preserve them, nor did He tell me to read them, and trust them as legitimate. Rather, men have told me that they are legitimate communication from God, and I am to trust them at every step in the alleged transmission process, from God to me, in a roundabout way. And, given how loose "John" appeared to have been with the words of Jesus, and given that several Gospel authors either trimmed, or embellished his words in places (given the differences in parallel passages in the various accounts), I have cause to doubt that these authors were merely acting as sounding boards, rather than editors and redactors. And, I cannot see their sources, or interview those who they may have interviewed, or speak to them, either. The same point made in this paragraph could be applied to Old Testament books in which God is allegedly being quoted.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Continuing on with the New Testament, I have a sort of meta-problem regarding what allegedly took place. The resurrection of Jesus was supposed to be the ultimate vindication of him by the God of the universe; a divine endorsement of him, and his message. Unfortunately, his resurrection was not made a public spectacle, to where there would be no doubt that it took place. He did not go into the Temple in Jerusalem, and proclaim to Caiaphas, "It is me, I have returned from the dead". He did not appear before all Jerusalem, so that the city would be in uproar, and there could be no doubt that the one who they had seen publicly killed in a grievous way was now standing before them whole. Instead, unfortunately, his alleged resurrection was only witnessed by a few close associates, and in private. And, none of their writings, if they ever made any, survive, with the exception of maybe one letter alleged to be from Peter, and "John's" alleged writings. The meta question would be, if God had raised Jesus from the dead, why not vindicate him publicly in such a way that none could deny it? Why instead make the object of faith for all who came in the future be the disputed writings alleged to come from a few close followers?
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This issue of the object of one's faith, which I have already mentioned, is a major point. The object of faith would not actually be Jesus, as I have never met Jesus, nor heard him speak. He has not told me anything. It would not be God, as I have never met God, and never heard Him speak. Neither God, nor Jesus ever told me to trust the Bible. So, my faith would not be in them. It would be in the men who are purporting to speak for them, and also those who gave me the writings which allegedly came from those men. The same is true of the Old Testament prophets. My faith in reading Isaiah is not in God. It is not even in Isaiah. It is in the writers, transmitters, editors, and translators of the book of Isaiah, that it actually represents what the man Isaiah said or taught. If I first put my faith in these men, then I can put my faith in the man Isaiah. But, I have never met Isaiah. I never witnessed whatever miracles that he may have performed as evidence of a divine commission. So, I have no valid reason to place my faith in the man Isaiah, that he is speaking for God. But, if I were to, my faith would still not be in God, but in Isaiah. Short of actually seeing the miraculous verification of his work, the best one can do is put their faith in man. And, since no Christians living today have ever seen any of the undeniably supernatural miracles of the Bible take place, none of them can actually say that they have their faith in God, properly speaking. They have their faith in men, who professed at various times to speak for God, and those who claimed to transmit their words. This means that denying the authority of the Bible is not denying God, or professing lack of faith in God. God never told me to read it, or trust it. If He did so, I would certainly do it. Refusing to do it after He told me so could be called a lack of faith in God. But refusing to trust the authenticity of the current Bible is something altogether different. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            But, this leap of faith is a bit of a brick wall. No matter how much one tries, they will never be able to go back in time, and actually verify with certainty that what they are reading actually happened. This is very frustrating for those who are aiming to stake their lives on the Bible. There is a point in which no more certainty can be achieved, and one ultimately has to trust in the authors, transmitters, and editors of the books that they are reading within the Bible. An "apologist answer" here may be that "God requires faith". But, as already discussed, this would be faith in human beings. If God Himself told me something, I would believe it, even if it was contrary to my own intuition, or seemed unlikely to me. <i>That</i> would be faith in God. This is something different. Additionally, God, in this scheme, would actually not have required faith for the extraordinarily lucky few who got to see the alleged supernatural confirmation of these writings. <i>They</i> would have been able to say that they had faith in God. However, for all others, their faith would, at best, be in mankind. This same brick wall comes into play when there are doctrinal controversies, and one cannot simply ask the authors of these books what they meant, or specifically believed, but I digress.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Therefore, before even getting into more specific examples of difficulties with the Bible itself (unlikely stories, possible contradictions, possible historical problems, etc.), I cannot really say that I am a Christian. I personally do not find it possible to base my life on the Bible currently, given some of the above considerations. When I read the Bible, I do not know if I am reading a message from God, or the heavily altered, edited, and redacted words of various people, who were writing what came to their minds. And, I cannot interact with any of the authors, neither do I have any supernatural proof for their claims to speak for God, nor has God told me to place my trust in it. This makes the religion of Christianity unlivable, in my opinion. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Specific Examples</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            I wanted to include some specific examples of other problems with the Bible that bothered me, so that it does not seem like this switch for me was only caused by a single issue which I thought I was unable to resolve. The following are from the book of Genesis alone:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <!-- <li>Genesis 1:6-7 firmament </li> -->
                            <li>A serpent being allowed to tempt Adam and Eve. The existence of a forbidden tree which would ruin mankind if only two people partook of it</li>
                            <li>The genealogies in Genesis chapter 5 and 11</li>
                            <li>Lifespans of hundreds and hundreds of years for the early people, while presenting some of them as being part of civilizations, with cities, metallurgy, etc.</li>
                            <li>The flood of Noah</li>
                            <li>Abraham is 86 years old when Ishmael is born (Genesis 16:16). Isaac is born when Abraham was 100 years old (Genesis 21:5), making Ishmael around 14 years old at that time. Ishmael is then cast out after Isaac is weaned (another few years) with his mother Hagar (Genesis 21:8-14), which would mean he was 16-17 years old. Yet, Ishamel is apparently spoken of as a little child would be spoken of (Genesis 21:14-18), not a 16-17 year old young man. Probably represents multiple stories or traditions being blended</li>
                            <li>Abraham's wife Sarah being taken for her beauty at around age 90 (Genesis 17:17, 20:2), after she laughed at a woman her age being able to bear (Genesis 18:12-15). She and Abraham also remarked on how old he was as well at 100 years old (Genesis 17:17, 18:12), despite Abraham's father being 130 when he had Abraham (Genesis 11:32, 12:4, Acts 7:4), and also the extreme age of some people in what would have been rather recent history, like Noah, who would have nearly contemporaneous with Abraham. If you sketch out the genealogies in Genesis 11:10-26, he lived to 950 years old, and died about 2 years before Abraham was born. Also his son Shem would have been alive when Abraham was born [Genesis 11:11], and he would have been over 400 years old as well, etc. Also, Abraham goes on to have 6 more kids with another wife after Sarah dies (Genesis 25:1-2), and dies at age 175 (Genesis 25:7-8), which makes his and Sarah's comments about his age (Genesis 17:17, 18:12) make little sense, given that he would have been about middle aged when Isaac was born. Probably represents multiple layers of editing and blending stories together</li>
                            <li>Lot impregnating his daughters on back-to-back nights, and those children growing up to be the patriarchs of the enemies of the Israelites (Genesis 19:32-38). They somehow have enough wine in the cave they have fled to, and Lot does it two nights in a row, and it says he did not know what happened. Seems like an etiological legend
                                <!-- Also related, SBL Commentary on Genesis 9:22-29: "Several texts suggest that, rather than eradicating them, Israel enslaved the Canaanites (Josh 9.21–23; 1 Kgs 9.16). The curse of Canaan may therefore be an attempt to give later Israelite behavior the authority of age."-->
                            </li>
                            <li>The scheme in Genesis 27:5-35 working (goats's hair does not feel like human hair), and then Isaac not revoking the blessing</li>
                            <!-- <li>Genesis 37:10 seems to speak of Rachel as still living, even though she died in Genesis 35:16-19. Probably multiple authors adding elements to the story of Joseph</li> Commented because it may refer to Jacob's other wife who raised Joseph -->
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            I could give many, many more examples of difficulties. I spent a lot of time trying to defend the Bible, so I know where a lot of the most difficult issues are. But, the above illustrate some of the things that lead to the tip in the scale towards unbelief, for me personally.
