                            The strongest argument against the resurrection of Jesus is that there is any debate about it at all. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Consider the purpose of the resurrection of Jesus in Christian theology. It was, in spite of Jesus's execution, the token of God's ultimate vindication of him. A proof that he was right after all, even though everyone who saw him executed thinks that he "lost".
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            But notice the extremely "convenient" nature of the story:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Jesus rose from the dead! Yet:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>No one gets to see him. He's gone now</li>
                                    <li>He allegedly appeared to his friends and followers for a little while, and then disappeared, and no one ever saw him again</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This is the opposite of vindication. This is instead exactly what one would expect if Jesus did not rise from the dead at all, and instead, the small sect that followed him refused to acknowledge that he was a false prophet.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Resurrection Narratives</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            It should go without saying that none of the resurrection narratives in the Gospels are trustworthy. They are written far too late, and functionally anonymously. Their historical value is limited to serving as references for what Christians 40+ years after Jesus's death may have believed.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            So, what is left? The Apostle Paul - who never saw Jesus - and his testimony that the early Christians preached the resurrection. Suppose that is true, and suppose that it started out as a physical resurrection and not a spiritual resurrection. Both of those granted, unfortunately, it remains that people lied back in the first century, too. And yes, even when it cost them everything, as there are certain people who are stubborn to the extent that they would literally rather <i>die</i> than admit that they were wrong, or that they had been tricked (into believing in Jesus, in this case).
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Big Picture</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Returning to the topic of vindication - consider whether it is vindicating for God to enact the following plan:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>He will raise the most important man to ever live from the dead - undoubtedly the most important event to ever happen - but then absolutely refuse to publicly vindicate him for the world to see. Instead, he will only have him appear to his friends, and then the rest of the world for all time will need to rely on second-hand accounts from those friends, in extremely late and contested writings</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            It seems convenient, because it is the opposite of what one would expect if Jesus actually rose from the dead, and it is exactly what one would expect if he did not rise from the dead, but had followers who desperately wanted him to be vindicated after he was executed, and who refused to admit that they had been tricked into unfortunately following a false prophet.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            If Jesus actually rose, why not have him stay and teach for a period of years or decades, so that all doubt could be banished forever? Because he did not actually rise from the dead. That is why the story is so convenient. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Object of Faith</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            If God raised Jesus from the dead, then any who actually saw the risen Jesus with their own eyes would be able to say that they have faith in God, and God's vindication of him. After all, they have supernatural proof of God's favor on him. This would be a valid object of faith.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            But, for all who have never seen the risen Jesus, their faith is not in God. It is instead in the unreliable testimonies of human beings. And, human beings lie - a lot - even over very important things, because they have agendas.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            So why would God shift the object of faith from direct evidence (seeing Jesus) to something that has burned every single human being to ever live (second-hand [and in this case, extremely contested] human testimony)? This shift rewards gullibility, and opens the door to lots of confusion, and the constant consideration of the possibility of fraud in the mind of any thinking person. It also makes verification impossible. In this scheme, the only ones who are rewarded are those who believe a story for which they have no evidence beyond the fervent assertions of the person in question's own followers. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            But how is the average person, two thousand years later, supposed to distinguish between the extraordinary claims of one devoted sect, which turn out to be true, and the extraordinary claims of another devoted sect, which turn out to be lies? Many groups throughout history have claimed many incredible miracles, which were supposed to vindicate them as being the "true religion". At this late stage of human history, so far removed from the events, if one chooses to make the leap of faith, it is a leap into faith into extremely shoddy, contested human testimony, not faith in God.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            However, in the case of Jesus specifically, the task is made easy, as one can examine the book that these people touted as being divine in their day (the <i>Tanakh</i>), see that it contains errors and absurdities, and come to the obvious conclusion that they were an unfortunately very confused, very angry sect of a false religion. Therefore, if they claimed - even under duress - that their executed leader rose from the dead (but no one gets to see him - he's disappeared now, don't ask), then one can conclude that they were lying, if they ever claimed such a thing at all.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            No, Jesus did not rise from the dead. If he did, there would be no question at all about it, because the vindication of God would be so clear, that the evidence would be unassailable, and all doubt would be banished forever.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            What is seen instead in Christianity is exactly what one would expect from the devoted followers of a failed apocalyptic prophet, who refused to admit that they had unfortunately been duped.
                        </p>
