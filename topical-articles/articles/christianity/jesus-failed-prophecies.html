                            This article will examine these prophecies, and how they failed to come to pass as predicted.

                        <h3>You Will Not Go Over All The Cities in Israel</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The first prophecy is contained within a lengthy speech given by Jesus to his 12 Apostles (Matthew 10:1-42), in which he tells them to preach "The kingdom of heaven is at hand" (Matthew 10:7), and says that they "shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake" (Matthew 10:18). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Then, he says:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Matthew 10:23</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                23 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Note in context that as the speech progresses, it seems to take on a wider scope than any immediate instruction, almost like these are final "marching orders". Consider the following:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Matthew 10:18-22</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                18 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles. <br>
                                19 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. <br>
                                20 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you. <br>
                                21 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death. <br>
                                22 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This is the immediate context of the passage in question. He speaks of the Apostles' future grand persecution, and the decline of society (Matthew 10:21). Then, he says, "You shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come" (Matthew 10:23).
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The task of going over all the cities of Israel would take a long time. Jesus himself did not cover nearly that much ground during his lifetime. This detail definitely supports the position that the "coming" spoken of in verse 23 refers to Jesus's "Parousia" (arrival as triumphant king of the Kingdom of Heaven).
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In other words, Jesus declared here that the Parousia would be very soon. He is stating here that it would occur before the Apostles were able to evangelize the entire nation of Israel. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            And, notice how he says it - "truly I say to you, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes". Here, Jesus is essentially making a promise. "Truly", he tells them, he will return before they even finish Israel. But, he did not. He made a prophecy about "the end" (Matthew 10:22), and the prophecy failed.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Common Christian responses to this charge of a failed prophecy are:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>That Jesus meant the Apostles' short-term journey before he rejoined them would not cover all of Israel. In other words, the "coming" refers not to the Parousia, but to Jesus rejoining the Apostles and continuing his ministry with them 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This is obviously not true, and in context, absurd. Jesus is speaking of "the end" (Matthew 10:22), and foretells intense persecution of the Apostles. There is nothing at all about such persecution happening in the Gospels on this trip, nor at any time prior to Jesus's death. When Jesus speaks about the "Son of Man" - an end times figure from Daniel 7:13-14, who rules the whole word - "coming" in Matthew, it clearly refers to the Parousia (Matthew 16:27-28, 24:3, 24:29-31), or at very least, for the sake of argument, a great end-times event, not him joining back up with them or resuming his acquaintance with them in a matter of weeks in his ministry. Further, he prefaces the statement with, "truly I say to you", which denotes a serious prophetic saying, not a casual statement that would essentially amount to "I'll see you soon in a few weeks"</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>That the "coming" here is not the Parousia, but Jesus "coming" and destroying Jerusalem in 70 AD
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Jesus did not "come" in 70 AD and destroy Jerusalem, a Roman army did. So, unless "Jesus" coming in his kingdom to Christians means a Pagan Roman army killing Jews in Israel - which seems rather blasphemous - this explanation should be rejected. Additionally, it should be rejected because examining the other statements Jesus made about the coming of the Son of Man renders any fulfillment at 70 AD absurd. This is the time when, specifically, the Son of Man is said "to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and will then repay every person according to his deeds" (Matthew 16:27-28), and, "the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory. And He will send forth His angels with a great trumpet blast, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other" (Matthew 24:30-31) - in other words, end-times, apocalyptic events, none of which happened at all in 70 AD</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>That the "coming" here <i>does</i> refer to the Parousia, and the Parousia has already taken place 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>No, it definitely hasn't, and anyone who could read Matthew 16 or 24 - even just the portions excerpted in the response above - and conclude that those things happened, is simply making nonsense of language, history, and the words of their own prophet</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            So, none of the proposed responses succeed in defending the prophecy. The language of the prophecies in Matthew disallow every proposed explanation, both for the passage in question from Matthew 10, and the others from Matthew 16 and 24. 
                        </p>
