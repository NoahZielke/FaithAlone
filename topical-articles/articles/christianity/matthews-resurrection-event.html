                            One of the most unbelievable passages in the Bible can be found in Matthew 27, where immediately after recording the death of Jesus, Matthew writes:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Matthew 27:50-53</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                50 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. <br>
                                51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; <br>
                                52 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, <br>
                                53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            It is easy to gloss over this, because it is found within the climax of the passion narrative. But, pause to consider what Matthew is asserting took place:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>"Many" (Matthew 27:52) dead saints rose from the dead, before Jesus (which actually seems to contradict a straightforward reading of 1 Corinthians 15:20-23)</li>
                            <li>They stood in their graves for three days, until after Jesus rose from the dead (Matthew 27:53)</li>
                            <li>They then appeared to "many" people in Jerusalem (Matthew 27:53)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Consider if this had actually happened. If dead people rose en masse, and appeared to many, one would expect there to be a massive uproar the likes of which had never been seen in the ancient world.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This is because in real life, when a dead person arrives at someone's doorstep, they don't shrug, and move on with their day. In real life, if a dead person appears at your doorstep, it becomes a defining event in your life - the most important thing to ever happen to you. You would hurry to tell every single person that you know, especially those who knew that person when they were alive. People would be frantic. And, word would spread extremely quickly, because in the ancient world, there is <i>far</i> less vying for one's attention relative to today. Every single person who learned of the resurrection would be eager to tell their friends, family, and strangers in casual conversation, especially when the resurrected person in question is <i>available for inspection</i>, in their own city.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This would be the case for a single resurrected person, let alone for "many". Matthew says that "many" rose, and that they appeared to "many". Then where are the testimonies of that event? Where is the commotion? 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Suppose someone came to you, and told you that last week, the president of the United States was walking around your town, taking pictures, and signing autographs, for the entire week. If you had not heard anything, despite interacting with coworkers, casually watching the news, and driving around town, you would conclude that the person who told you that is joking, or lying. That is because world-shattering, life-defining events are reasonably expected to cause a proportional level of commotion. Therefore, an indication that none of the Bible's many earth-shattering miracles took place is the absence of any wide-scale conversion in first century Israel, and the utter lack of any disinterested contemporary (e.g., a government) confirming a spree of astounding miracles. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Matthew's resurrection story may be one of the most egregious fictions, because it is so obviously not true, and definitely did not happen. But even the more benign miracles which Jesus is said to have performed in front of thousands of spectators are exposed as fictional by their failure to generate a proportional level of commotion. All historical evidence says that the Jesus movement remained extremely small in the first century, with most Jews ignoring it - something utterly impossible given how real human beings actually would respond to witnessing a miracle. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            If a real human being were to see a miraculous event, it would be very obvious, because it would be a seminal moment in their life, which would shape the entire trajectory of their future. If thousands of human beings saw miraculous events - as the Bible records during the ministry of Jesus and the Apostles - then far more commotion would result than is actually seen in history for the areas in which they were supposed to have taken place. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Therefore, because the Bible records so much fire, and yet history reveals so little smoke, it is safe to assume that the miracles of the Bible are fictional, and never took place.
                        </p>
