                                13 In the course of his revolution, O Brāhmaṇas, he illuminates the quarters. With the mass of his rays and accompanied by the wind all round, the sun takes away the water of the entire world, O excellent Brāhmaṇas.  <br>
                                14 The moon transmits the entire water drunk by the sun. The torrential current of water (Downpour of rain) functions through Nāḍis (veinlike vessels) accompanied by the wind.  <br>
                                15 The water that oozes out of the moon remains in the food (i.e. plants and food crops). <br>
                                16 Being obstructed by the wind, the clouds scatter water over the earth. Thus water is continuously raised up (i.e. turned into vapour) and dropped down.
                                <!-- 17 There is no total destruction of water. The same water gets transformed. It is for the sake of sustenance of all the worlds that this cosmic Māyā has been created (by the lord). <br>
                                18 The three worlds along with the mobile and immobile beings are pervaded by this Māyā. The sun is the lordly creator of the worlds. Endowed with a thousand (innumerable eyes) he is the lord of the universe. He is the mighty lord of the subjects, the creator of the entire universe. <br>
                                19 The water that has fallen down from the moon, from the sky, is conducive to the welfare of all the worlds. The entire universe has the moon as its support. This has been truthfully recounted.  <br>
                                20 The Uṣṇa (hot virility) oozes out of the sun, and the Śita (chill virility) functions from the moon. <br>
                                21 These two, viz. the moon of cool virility and the sun of hot virility, sustain the world by means of their combination. -->

                                13 O Brahmanas, in the course of his revolution, the sun brightens the quarters by his brilliance. With the mass of his rays in the company of the wind all round, O excellent Brahmanas, the sun takes up the waters of the universe. <br>
                                14 The water drunk in by the sun gets transferred to the moon from the solar fire. Through the Nadis (tubular veins) full of wind the activity of sustaining the worlds begins. <br>
                                15 What exudes from the moon, the sun receives at its tips. When the wind blows the clouds let it shower on the earth. <br>
                                16 Thus the water is poured and it falls again and again. The same water assumes various shapes.

                                During eight months of the year the sun attracts the waters, which are the essence of all fluids, and then pours them upon earths (during the other four months) as rain: from rain grows corn; and by corn the whole world subsists. <br>
                                The sun with his scorching rays absorbs the moisture of the earth, and with them nourishes the moon. The moon communicates, through tubes of air, its dews to the clouds, which, being composed of smoke, fire, and wind (or vapour), can retain the waters with which they are charged: they are therefore called Abhras, because their contents are not dispersed. <br>
                                When however they are broken to pieces by the wind, then watery stores descend, bland, and freed front every impurity by the sweetening process of time.

                            The above citations are correct in stating that the sun evaporates water. However, this water is not communicated to the moon. Rather, as the evaporated moisture rises, it cools, and condenses into clouds, eventually raining down to earth.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Throughout this process, of course, the water never gets anywhere near either the sun or the moon. It stays within earth's atmosphere. Therefore, this is another example of scientific error within Hinduism.
