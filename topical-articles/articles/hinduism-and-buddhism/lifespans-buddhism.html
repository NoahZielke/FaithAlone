                            In Buddha's Long Discourses (Digha Nikaya), he tells of a time in which people used to live for 80,000 years, yet because of wickedness, they had their lifespans gradually halved:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Digha Nikaya - Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                14 Thus, from the not giving of property to the needy, poverty became rife; from the growth of poverty, the taking of what was not given increased; from the increase of theft, the use of weapons increased; from the increased use of weapons, the taking of life increased; and from the increase in the taking of life, people's life-span decreased, their beauty decreased, and as a result of this decrease of life-span and beauty, the children of those whose life-span had been eighty thousand years lived for only forty thousand.
                            </p>

                            He continues repeating the above for successive generations, from the 80,000 year lifespan generation, to 40,000, 20,000, 10,000, 5,000, 2,500, 1,000, 500, 250, and 100 year lifespan generations, with 100 years apparently representing the present time. He then prophesies that eventually this cycle will cause lifespans to be only 10 years:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Digha Nikaya - Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                18 Thus, from the not giving of property to the needy, ...lack of respect for mother and father, for ascetics and Brahmins, and for the head of the clan increased, and in consequence people's life-span and beauty decreased, and the children of those whose life-span had been two-and-a-half centuries lived for only a hundred years. <br><br>
                                
                                19 Monks, a time will come when the children of these people will have a life-span of ten years. And with them, girls will be marriageable at five years old. And with them, these will be unmanageable at five years old. And with them, these flavours will disappear: ghee, butter, sesame-oil, molasses and salt. Among them, kudrūsa-grain will be the chief food, just as rice and curry are today. And with them, the ten courses of moral conduct will completely disappear, and the ten courses of evil will prevail exceedingly: for those of a ten-year life-span there will be no word for "moral"; so how can there be anyone who acts in a moral way? 
                            </p>

                            After this, he prophesies that the trend will begin to reverse, and lifespans will start to double again, until they are once again built up to 80,000 years:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Digha Nikaya - Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                21 And so they will abstain from the taking of life, and, having undertaken this good thing, will practise it. And through having undertaken such wholesome things, they will increase in life-span and beauty. And the children of those whose life-span was ten years will live for twenty years. <br><br>
                                
                                22 Then it will occur to those beings: "It is through having taken to wholesome practices that we have increased in life-span and beauty, so let us perform still more wholesome practices. Let us refrain from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from lying speech, from slander, from harsh speech, from idle chatter, from covetousness, from ill-will, from wrong views; let us abstain from three things: incest, excessive greed, and deviant practices; let us respect our mothers and fathers, ascetics and Brahmins, and the head of the clan, and let us persevere in these wholesome actions." <br><br>
                                
                                And so they will do these things, and on account of this they will increase in life-span and in beauty. The children of those whose life-span is twenty years will live to be forty, their children will live to be eighty, their children to be a hundred and sixty, their children to be three hundred and twenty, their children to be six hundred and forty; the children of those whose life-span is six hundred and forty years will live for two thousand years, their children for four thousand, their children for eight thousand, and their children for twenty thousand. The children of those whose life-span is twenty thousand years will live to be forty thousand, and their children will attain to eighty thousand years. <br><br>

                                23 Among the people with an eighty thousand-year lifespan, girls will become marriageable at five hundred. And such people will know only three kinds of disease: greed, fasting, and old age. And in the time of those people this continent of Jambudipa (India) will be powerful and prosperous, and villages, towns and cities will be but a cock's flight one from the next. This Jambudipa, like Avīci, will be as thick with people as the jungle is thick with reeds and rushes. At that time the Varanasi of today will be a royal city called Ketumati, powerful and prosperous, crowded with people and well-supplied. In Jambudipa there will be eighty-four thousand cities headed by Ketumati as the royal capital.

                            Scientifically speaking, granting any theory of Evolution, there was never a time in which human beings lived for 80,000 years. The entirety of the history of civilization would look drastically different, if that had ever been the case. The same can be said of 40,000 years, 20,000 years, 10,000 years, etc.

                            Likewise, living virtuously does not cause one's lifespan, or that of their children, to genetically double (which would require their gametes' DNA to be altered, and that alteration passed onto their children). And, living wickedly does not cause one's lifespan to genetically cut in half, either. <!-- Africa, a place which has historically rejected Buddha as a false prophet, has seen its lifespan nearly double in the past century. -->

                            Therefore, this teaching of Buddha is an instance of multiple scientific errors in Buddhism.
