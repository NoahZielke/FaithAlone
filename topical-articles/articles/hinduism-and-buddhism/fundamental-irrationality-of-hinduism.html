                            In Hinduism, the term <i>Vedanta</i> is used to describe schools of thought or philosophy. The three major schools of Vedanta are Advaita, Vishishtadvaita, and Dvaita, and they are distinguished from one another with respect to how they view the relationship between the individual soul/Self (Atman) and the ultimate reality (Brahman):
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Advaita Vedanta - Teaches Non-Dualism, which is to say, Atman and Brahman are one and the same. Moksha (liberation, salvation) is obtained by recognizing that the Self (Atman) is Brahman, and all distinctions are ultimately illusory. This ignorance of the unified nature of reality - the illusion that there are distinctions - is called Maya</li>
                            <li>Vishishtadvaita Vedanta - Teaches Qualified Non-Dualism, meaning Atman is united to Brahman, yet there is a real distinction between them. Moksha is usually obtained by devotion to Vishnu (Brahman)</li>
                            <li>Dvaita Vedanta - Teaches Dualism, meaning that Atman is distinct from Brahman, and always will remain distinct. Moksha is obtained by devotion to Vishnu (Brahman)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            There is much to say about how Hinduism, as it developed, and came into contact with monotheistic religions, gradually became a religion where Vishnu (or less commonly, Shiva or Shakti/Devi) is seen as the primary God, especially after the age of the Puranas (early centuries AD), and the influence of the Bhakti Movement. This development can be seen in the latter two schools above (Vishishtadvaita, Dvaita).
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            However, this article aims to argue the two following points:

                            <li>A non-dualistic view, where Atman is Brahman, is fundamentally irrational</li>

                            The following quotations will come from the Ten Principal Upanishads, which long predate the Puranas, and are part of the Vedas. Because there are so many quotations, the following section will cover one quotation which establishes each of the following points of Advaita Vedanta:

                            <li>Moksha is experiential unity with Brahman</li>

                            Additional quotations for each point of doctrine will be listed in Appendices after each section.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            While the teaching that Atman is Brahman is found by implication many times in the Upanishads, what follows is a direct statement of this point of Advaita Vedanta:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Mandukya Upanishad - Chapter 1</h5>

                                1 OM! This Imperishable Word is the whole of this visible universe. Its explanation is as follows: What has become, what is becoming, what will become - verily, all of this is OM. And what is beyond these three states of the world of time - that too, verily, is OM. <br>
                                2 All this, verily, is Brahman. <b>The Self is Brahman.</b> This Self has four quarters. <br>
                                6 This is the Lord of All; the Omniscient; the Indwelling Controller; the Source of All. This is the beginning and end of all beings.

                            The Self, when capitalized, refers to Atman, which is essentially the eternal soul. And, the above states that "The Self is Brahman" - "The Source of All" - "the beginning and ending of all beings".

                            If Atman is equivalent to Brahman, it must likewise be eternal. The following states that it is "not born", "has not sprung from anything", and is "birthless, eternal, everlasting":

                                18 <b>The knowing Self is not born; It does not die. It has not sprung from anything; nothing has sprung from It. Birthless, eternal, everlasting and ancient,</b> It is not killed when the body is killed. <br>
                                19 If the killer thinks he kills and if the killed man thinks he is killed, neither of these

                                19 He who deems It (the Self) a slayer, and he who thinks of It as slain - both are ignorant. For, the Self neither slays nor is slain. <br>
                                20 <b>It (the Self) is never born; It never dies; having come into being once, It never ceases to be. Unborn, eternal, abiding and primeval,</b> It is not slain when the body is slain. <br>

                                22 Just as a man casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so also the embodied Self casts off worn-out bodies and enters others which are new. <br>
                                23 Weapons do not cleave It (the Self), fire does not burn It, waters do not wet It, and wind does not dry It. <br>

                                25 This (Self) is said to be unmanifested, unthinkable and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing This to be such, thou shouldst not grieve.

                            The above is even more forceful than the passage from the Katha Upanishad. The Self is "eternal, indestructible and immeasurable", it "is never born, it never dies", it is "unborn, eternal", "eternal, unborn", "eternal, all-pervading", and "unmanifested".

                                8 This Self is dearer than a son, dearer than wealth, dearer than everything else, and is innermost.

One should meditate upon the Self alone as dear. Of him who meditates upon the Self alone as dear, the dear ones are not mortal. <br>
                                9 They say: Men think, 'Through the knowledge of Brahman we shall become all'. Well, what did that Brahman know by which It became all? <br>

                            The existence of Maya, and more broadly, the situation in which, for some reason, there are embodied beings needing to realize that Atman is Brahman in order to merge back into Brahman, makes no sense. Is Brahman tormenting itself? Did Brahman create confusion, and pain, in order to make itself realize that it is itself, in order to merge back into a truly single unit once again? <!-- And, what is stopping Brahman from creating a situation with even <i>more</i> suffering in the future, even after all has been re-merged into itself?  -->

                        <p class="article-body">
                            In Christianity, this type of problem does not exist, because the souls of beings are <i>created</i> by God, and distinct from Him. That is why there is suffering - we are not God. Once that is replaced with a Non-Dualistic view, like that of Hinduism, suffering becomes nonsensical, as ultimately, the ultimate reality would have to have created that suffering for itself. <!-- but for what purpose? An ultimate re-unification of what had already been there before the suffering. (this is covered above) -->

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Hinduism teaches that ultimate reality, Brahman, must be realized in spite of the obfuscation of Maya. This is fundamentally nonsensical, and terminates in the conclusion that Brahman created for itself a situation of confusion and suffering.

                                4 "Brahman is," thus said one who knew the science of Brahman; and this penance is the door to Brahman, thus said one who by penance had cast off all sin. The syllable Om is the manifest greatness of Brahman, thus said one who well grounded (in Brahman) always meditates on it. Therefore by knowledge, by penance, and by meditation is Brahman gained. Thus one goes beyond Brahman (Hiranyagarbha), and to a divinity higher than the gods; nay, he who knows this, and worships Brahman by these three (by knowledge, penance, and meditation), obtains bliss imperishable, infinite, and unchangeable. Then freed from those things (the senses of the body, &c.) by which he was filled and overcome, a mere charioteer, <b>he obtains union with the Self.'</b> <br><br>

                                5 The Valakhilyas said: 'O Saint, thou art the teacher, thou art the teacher. What thou hast said, has been properly laid up in our mind. Now answer us a further question: Agni, Vayu, Aditya, Time (kala) which is Breath (prana), Food (anna), Brahma, Rudra, Vishnu, thus do some meditate on one, some on another. Say which of these is the best for us.' He said to them: <br><br>
                                
                                6 'These are but the chief manifestations of the highest, the immortal, the incorporeal Brahman. He who is devoted to one, rejoices here in his world (presence), thus he said. Brahman indeed is all this, and a man may meditate on, worship, or discard also those which are its chief manifestations. With these (deities) he proceeds to higher and higher worlds, and when all things perish, <b>he becomes one with the Purusha, yes, with the Purusha.'</b>

What if I argued this - Hinduism is fundamnetally irrational in light of the teaching that Atman is Brahman. For, if Atman were Brahman, then ultimately, that reality is responsible (impersonally) for creating the maya of the self (lowercase), which is the cause of our current predicament


The argument you're presenting—claiming that **Hinduism is fundamentally irrational** due to the **Atman is Brahman** teaching—raises a philosophical challenge about **causality**, **responsibility**, and the nature of **maya** (illusion) in **Advaita Vedanta**. Specifically, you seem to be pointing out a potential issue of **internal contradiction** in the Advaitic view: if **Brahman** (the ultimate reality) is the only true existence and **Atman** is identical to Brahman, then how does the illusion of **maya** (which leads to suffering and ignorance) arise in the first place, and wouldn't Brahman itself be responsible for it?

Let's break down the argument and explore how a follower of **Advaita Vedanta** might respond, along with some critiques and counter-critiques.

### 1. **The Argument: If Atman is Brahman, Then Brahman is Responsible for Maya**
   - In **Advaita Vedanta**, **Brahman** is the ultimate, non-dual reality, and the **individual self (Atman)** is ultimately identical with Brahman.
   - The **problem** arises because **maya**—the illusory power that makes us perceive the world of multiplicity and duality, and makes the **lower self** seem real—is part of the **human predicament**. **Maya** is what keeps people ignorant of the truth that Atman is Brahman.
   - Therefore, if **Atman is Brahman** and **Brahman is the ultimate reality**, then Brahman itself must be responsible for the creation of **maya**.
   - If Brahman is responsible for creating maya, which causes suffering and ignorance, then it seems **Brahman is implicated** in causing the **illusion** that leads to human suffering. This, you might argue, makes the teaching irrational because it creates a scenario where the **ultimate, perfect reality** is responsible for the **imperfections** of the human condition.

### 2. **The Traditional Advaita Vedanta Response**
An **Advaitin** (a follower of Advaita Vedanta) would likely respond by explaining several key concepts:

#### a. **Maya is Beginningless but Not Real**
   - According to Advaita Vedanta, **maya** is **beginningless** but not **real** in the same way Brahman is. Maya has no **absolute existence** but only **relative existence**—it exists **only as long as we are ignorant** of the true nature of reality.
   - **Maya** is often described as **anirvachaniya**—"indescribable." It is not **real** because it is negated upon the realization of **Brahman**, but it is not **unreal** because it has practical effects in the world of appearances.
   - **Brahman** itself is not subject to maya, and Brahman does not "create" maya in a way that implies responsibility. Rather, **maya** is an **illusion** that appears to exist when the individual soul is in a state of ignorance.

#### b. **Brahman is Beyond Cause and Effect**
   - In Advaita, **Brahman** is considered **nirguna** (without attributes), **changeless**, and **beyond cause and effect**. Since **Brahman is beyond duality**, it does not act or create in the way we understand creation. The world, including maya, is **not a creation of Brahman** but an **appearance** that arises due to ignorance.
   - From the perspective of **Brahman**, maya has no ultimate reality. The illusion of maya is sustained only in the **relative realm** of **samsara** (the cycle of birth and rebirth). Once one realizes the **truth** of Brahman, maya is seen as **non-existent**—it simply dissolves.

#### c. **Ignorance is the Problem, Not Brahman**
   - The root of the problem, according to Advaita, is not **Brahman** but the individual **jiva's ignorance (avidya)**. The ignorance is what causes the jiva to **misidentify** itself as a separate, lower self, distinct from Brahman. This ignorance leads to the experience of duality, suffering, and the cycle of samsara.
   - **Brahman** remains **pure** and **untouched** by this ignorance. It is only when the individual attains **jnana (knowledge)** of their true nature that maya disappears, and the identity of **Atman with Brahman** is realized.

### 3. **Counter-Critique: Is This a Satisfactory Response?**
While Advaita Vedanta offers a robust philosophical framework to address this challenge, there are still **critiques** one could offer based on your argument:

#### a. **Maya as a Logical Contradiction**
   - If **Brahman** is the only true reality, and everything else is **maya**, the notion that something as powerful as **maya** could arise **independently** of Brahman raises questions. How can **ignorance (avidya)** or **illusion (maya)** exist **without a cause**? If maya has no **real existence**, how can it have such a profound effect on **sentient beings**?
   - From a rational perspective, if maya leads to such **widespread ignorance and suffering**, there seems to be a **causal gap** in explaining how it arises in the first place. Even if **Brahman** is beyond cause and effect, the fact that maya exists on any level seems to require some kind of **explanation** beyond just being an **illusion**.

#### b. **The Issue of Responsibility**
   - Even if Brahman is **beyond duality**, the very fact that the **individual self (Atman)** is ultimately **Brahman** seems to imply some level of **responsibility** for the existence of **ignorance**. Why would a **perfect, non-dual reality** allow or sustain the illusion of **maya** and the consequent suffering of countless beings?
   - You might argue that, philosophically, this creates a **tension**: If Brahman is pure, eternal, and free from duality, how can the **illusion** of duality exist so persistently? Doesn't the fact that maya continues to deceive **countless jivas** imply that Brahman, in some sense, permits or sustains this deception?

### 4. **Alternative Hindu Perspectives (Dvaita and Vishishtadvaita)**
It's worth noting that other schools of Hindu thought, like **Dvaita Vedanta** (dualism) and **Vishishtadvaita Vedanta** (qualified non-dualism), offer solutions to this perceived problem by maintaining a **real distinction** between **Atman** (the individual soul) and **Brahman (God)**.

#### a. **Dvaita Vedanta (Dualism)**
   - In **Dvaita Vedanta**, the **soul (Atman)** and **Brahman** are eternally **distinct**. This resolves the issue by affirming that Brahman (often identified with **Vishnu**) is a **personal God** who is separate from individual souls and the material world.
   - In this view, Brahman is **not responsible** for the suffering caused by maya; rather, **individual souls** are responsible for their own actions through the **law of karma**.

#### b. **Vishishtadvaita Vedanta (Qualified Non-Dualism)**
   - **Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita** offers a middle path, where **Atman** and **Brahman** are distinct but also **inseparable**. Brahman (often identified with **Vishnu**) is the **personal God** who governs the universe, and individual souls are **dependent** on God but retain their distinctiveness.
   - Here, **maya** is real but **subordinate** to Brahman's will, and Brahman actively helps souls overcome ignorance through **grace** and **devotion (bhakti)**.

### 5. **Conclusion: The Debate over Maya's Rationality**
The argument you've proposed touches on a **long-standing philosophical tension** within Advaita Vedanta about the **nature of maya** and the relationship between **Brahman** and the **world of illusion**. While Advaita Vedanta provides answers based on **maya's illusory nature** and Brahman's **transcendence**, this response may not satisfy all critics, particularly those looking for **clear causal explanations**.

Ultimately, the **Advaita perspective** focuses on the idea that the **individual self** must realize that **maya** is **unreal**, and only **ignorance** perpetuates the illusion. From this view, rational objections to maya are themselves **products of ignorance**, and the only true solution is **self-realization**. Nevertheless, the **tension** between the **non-dual** philosophy and the **experience of duality** remains a rich area of discussion in **Hindu philosophy**.
