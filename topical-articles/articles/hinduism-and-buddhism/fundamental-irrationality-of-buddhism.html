                            Mainstream Theravada Buddhism, based primarily on the Pali Canon, teaches:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Everything is impermanent</li>
                            <li>As such, there is no eternal, unchanging "self"</li>
                            <li>The illusion that there is a "self" is a primary cause of (bad) desire/craving</li>
                            <li>This causes us to reincarnate</li>
                            <li>Liberation from this cycle can only be obtained by following Buddha's method, which principally includes ridding oneself of the illusion that they have an unchanging "self"</li>
                            <li>There is no personal God (or if there is, knowing that there is one isn't worth thinking about, and is irrelevant to humanity's situation)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In this system, somehow, sentient beings reincarnate. That seems to imply that there is a personal God managing the law of Karma, and doling out punishments/rewards accordingly, by assigning beings to different Hells (Buddhist Hells are famously extremely horrifying - their inventors delighted in horrifying and graphic imagery), or different births, etc. What is causing this to take place if there is no personal, eternal (refuting the idea that everything is impermanent) God? Who is in charge? Who made the universe, and then decided that Karma would be the operative force in the universe, and programmed it to work in the way that it does, where for some reason, the beings (conveniently) get memory-wiped between lives (though apparently not in the Hell realms, for some reason), dragging the system out, preventing learning, and eliminating progress?
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Additionally, why would sentient beings exist at all, if their only purpose is to realize that they have no eternal self, crave nothing, and then phase into the impermanent, selfless, emptiness<!-- nothingness --> of Buddha's metaphysics? It cannot be for the purpose of character building - there is no self. Whatever is "learning" throughout successive reincarnations is not an individual "self" - that is the whole point. So, why do sentient beings exist? Why make a system in which there are sentient beings, who reincarnate until they realize that they actually have no permanent self? Why would realizing this make someone stop reincarnating, and what would be the purpose in arranging a system like this? Again, character building is not an option, because there are no permanent "selves". 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In Buddha's theory, whoever made sentient beings which are capable of the illusion that they have a permanent "self" is the cause of all the trouble. They created a cosmic torture chamber, in which these beings suffer, except there is actually no "them", because they have no eternal "self". Rather, it is just impermanent "stuff" suffering by thinking it is permanent. For some reason, this situation exists. There may or may not be a personal God (Buddha famously <a href="../hinduism-and-buddhism/deficient-philosophy-buddhism.html" target="_blank">remained silent on the issue</a>) who is responsible for this needless, impersonal suffering simulator. Or, it may just be a brute fact - a suffering simulator <i>ex nihilo</i>.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Or, put another way:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>There are no "selves", only impermanent processes</li>
                            <li>These processes suffer because they are deluded into believing that they <i>are</i> "selves"</li>
                            <li>They cycle through rebirth and torment based on Karma and craving</li>
                            <li>Liberation is realizing that the "self" was never real</li>
                            <li>But if no one is really there, and the goal is to realize that, then what's the point of this entire suffering system to begin with? It is like building a cosmic trap for delusion, but no one actually falls into it, because there was never a real "someone" to begin with</li>
                            <!-- So, why have a suffering world at all, if it is only bundles of conditions imagining that they are suffering "selves"? -->
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Then, of course, all of this hinges on one ex-Hindu guy's word from the 5th century BC. What is Buddha's proof that reincarnation takes place? Buddha says so<!-- (and no - there is no proof whatsoever for reincarnation, and no sensible reason that <i>all</i> human beings would not remember <i>all</i> of their past lives if it actually happened) -->. What is Buddha's proof that following his method will actually stop a person from being reborn? Buddha says so. Why should anyone trust what Buddha says, beyond "because Buddha said so"? He is a former Hindu, who admittedly had no idea how to achieve his goal when he started. The method that he came up with via speculation, built upon his Hindu assumptions of reincarnation and Karma, as demonstrated above, is illogical.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            When examined at a high level, or subjected to the slightest amount of scrutiny, the entire Buddhist system collapses into complete nonsense.

                                Anatta (not-self) is a central teaching of the Buddha, as is rebirth. How do we put these seemingly contradictory teachings together? The Buddha taught that freedom from samsara, the repetitive round of birth and death, is possible through the understanding of not-selfâ€”that nothing whatsoever can be clung to as me or mine. So it could be said that rebirth affects those who cling to a sense of self but ends for those who release such clinging.

But the Buddha taught that there is no such permanent essence.
