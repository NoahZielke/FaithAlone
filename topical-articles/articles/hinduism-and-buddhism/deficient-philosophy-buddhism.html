                            Buddha's response above is essentially to refuse to answer, or take a position on either question. He denies that he holds the view that the world is eternal, or that it is not eternal. He denies that he holds the view that the world is infinite, or that it is finite. This means that he has no view on these questions - he is agnostic.

                            Notice that just as with the eternality and infinitude of the universe, these are extremely fundamental questions about reality. And, similarly, Buddha remains agnostic, refusing to take any position.

                                7 "Therefore, Malunkyaputta, remember what I have left undeclared as undeclared, and remember what I have declared as declared. And what have I left undeclared? 'The world is eternal' - I have left undeclared. 'The world is not eternal' - I have left undeclared. 'The world is finite' - I have left undeclared. 'The world is infinite' - I have left undeclared. 'The soul is the same as the body' - I have left undeclared. 'The soul is one thing and the body another' - I have left undeclared. 'After death a Tathagata exists' - I have left undeclared. 'After death a Tathagata does not exist' - I have left undeclared. 'After death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist' - I have left undeclared.

                            Above, Buddha said that he remained agnostic on many matters pertaining to the fundamental nature of reality because "it is unbeneficial, it does not belong to the fundamentals of the holy life, it does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana". Instead, according to himself, he only taught on the origin of suffering, and the means of attaining the cessation of suffering.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Buddhism, therefore, can never be anything more than a philosophically deficient religion. There can be no answer, or even speculation, on such things as how the universe exists, the nature of a person's soul, or even existence after death - all fundamental, vital questions, which define how a person views reality. The founder of the religion has declared such topics "unbeneficial", and elsewhere "beset by suffering, by vexation, by despair" (Aggivacchagotta Sutta 14).
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Consider some of the implications of Buddha's agnostic approach to these fundamental questions of reality:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>
                                If the universe is not eternal, then it must have been created at some point, by an agent intelligent enough to design it, and powerful enough to create it. This position, therefore, would directly imply the existence of a personal God, who is eternal. This, however, would have massive implications for a person's view of Buddha, and the religion that he created. This God would be the designer of Karma, and rebirth. He would be the one who made all the rules for how it works. So, if Buddha were to venture to tell humanity how to escape Samsara (rebirth), he would logically need to have been commissioned by this God. Why else would anyone care what Buddha has to say? Without a divine commission, or even claim of divine revelation, he has no basis for asserting that following his method will stop someone from being reborn. His authority depends on God existing, and him having been sent by that God, with the correct method to stop the cycle. Of course, the same can be said of Buddha's teaching, borrowed from Hinduism, that rebirth is taking place in the first place, and that karma is operative on that process. Why would anyone believe Buddha's assertions that these things happen, if he has not received revelation from God that they take place? <br><br>

                                Suppose, on the other hand, that the universe is eternal. Then, there are a few options regarding God and His relation to it. He could be co-eternal with it. He Himself could be the universe. It could constitute a part of Himself. Each of these things would have massive implications for Buddhism, and one's view of Buddha, for the aforementioned reason - if God exists, one should get their information on the nature of reality either from Him, or from one that He directly communicated with, or gave knowledge to. Otherwise, there is no reason to believe someone's speculations as to the nature of reality, such as the existence of rebirth. <br><br>
                            
                                In any case, Buddha's system definitely seems to imply that there must be a transcendent, intelligent agent, if for no other reason than someone needed to design the Karmic system of rebirth on which Buddha's religion is based. Otherwise, who made the rules? Who decided that sentient beings would exist, and need to learn to cease bad desires, or otherwise be reborn? Who is managing that system? And, otherwise, why should anyone believe Buddha's speculations on the nature of reality? <br><br>

                                Yet, consider how unfinished and deficient the necessity of God renders Buddha's religion. His religion requires a God, and the existence, nature, will, and identity of that God would have massive implications for every aspect of Buddhism, and yet, Buddha failed to define the universe's relationship to God, by failing to teach that He created it, or is co-eternal with it, or something else.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                If the soul is the same as the body, then when the body is destroyed, a person would cease to exist, and the entire basis of Buddha's religion - the cycle of Samsara - would be refuted. Buddha's religion requires a non-material component to a person, which remains identified with that person after death, and across potentially innumerable bodies. So, Buddha's religion seems to absolutely depend on a person's body not being the same as their soul. Therefore, his agnosticism on the subject does not really make sense.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                If one who reaches enlightenment does not continue to exist after death, then whatever created sentient beings, and designed Samsara, wanted those beings to (1) exist, (2) learn that existence is to suffer, (3) follow Buddha's method to cease desire, then (4) cease to exist, which is absurd, and pointless. In such a situation, the one responsible for the existence of sentient beings, and Samsara, will have created a cosmic torture chamber, for no reason. <br><br>

                                On the other hand, if an enlightened person continues to exist after death in some form, then this would have massive implications on Buddhism's doctrine of the self, its relation to God or the ultimate reality, the purpose of sentient beings, and much more. <br><br>

                                In any case, this is considering the final result of following Buddha's religion. By remaining agnostic on this issue, he literally refused to teach on what happens to one if they listen to him, and follow his method. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Buddha did not have answers to many of life's most important questions, because he created an errant, deficient philosophy, which was unable to accommodate many of life's most important questions. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Consequently, there are no answers in Buddhism. A person's origins, nature, and fate are all purposefully forbidden to be speculated on, lest they distract from the method that the religion's founder insists, based on his own authority, will solve a person's problem of Samsara (rebirth), which he insists takes place, also based on nothing more than his own authority.
