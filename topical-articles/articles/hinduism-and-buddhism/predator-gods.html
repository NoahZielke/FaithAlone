                            Many of the Hindu gods, including all three members of the Trimurti - Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma - are recorded in Hindu scriptures engaging in sexual predation.

                            In the Shiva Purana, Vishnu is said to have deceived Vrinda, giving her a false dream indicating that something was wrong with her husband, Jalandhara, who had gone to fight against Shiva. She goes to the forest with her friends, wherein Vishnu is waiting for her, and tells her that Jalandhara died, but, he will resuscitate him. However, he merely takes the form of Jalandhara, and proceeds to have intercourse with Vrinda. When Vrinda realizes what has been done to her by Vishnu, she immolates herself:

                            <p class="mb-1">
                                2 After going to the city of Jalandhara, <b>Viṣṇu thought of violating the chastity of Vṛndā.</b> <br>
                                3 The foremost among those who wield illusion, he assumed a wonderful body and stationed himself in a park of the city. He made Vṛndā see a dream. <br>
                                4 The gentle lady Vṛndā, the wife of Jalandhara, though of pure rites, had a very bad dream at night on account of Viṣṇu's power of illusion. <br>
                                5 In the dream as a result of Viṣṇu's power of illusion she saw the naked form of her husband anointed with oil and seated on a buffalo. <br>
                                6 He was proceeding in the southern direction. His head had been completely shaved. He was wearing black flowers to decorate himself. He was being served by a number of Asuras. He was completely encompassed by darkness. <br>
                                7 Later, towards the end of the night she had various bad dreams, such as the whole city was submerged in the sea, all of a sudden, along with herself. <br>
                                8 Then the lady woke up still thinking of the dream she had had. She saw the rising sun with a hole in the middle and fading repeatedly. <br>
                                9 On realising that it was a bad portent, the terrified lady began to cry. She did not feel happy at all in the spacious terraces and towers of the palace. <br>
                                10 With two of her friends she then went to the park in the city. Even there she did not find herself at ease. <br>
                                11 Then she, the dejected gloomy wife of Jalandhara, wandered from forest to forest. She was not conscious of even herself. <br>
                                20 "O lord, Jalandhara my husband has gone to fight Śiva. O holy one of good rites, how does he fare in the war? Please tell me." <br>
                                21 On hearing her words, the sage feigned a deceptive silence. <b>Fully aware of the means of achieving his selfish ends he looked up sympathetically.</b> <br>
                                22 In the meantime two lordly monkeys came there and stood bowing down in front of him. At a significant gesture from his eyebrows, the monkeys rose into the sky again. <br>
                                23 O great sage, within a trice, they came back taking with them his head, body and limbs and stood in front of the sage. <br>
                                24 On seeing the head, body and limbs of her husband, Vṛndā fell unconscious, extremely pained at the misery of her lord. <br>
                                31 "O excellent sage, storehouse of mercy, eager to help others, O gentle sir, take pity on me and resuscitate my lord. <br>
                                32 O great sage, I know that you are competent to enliven him again. Hence please resuscitate my beloved husband." <br>
                                33 After saying this, the chaste wife of the Daitya fell at his feet heaving sighs of grief. <br>
                                34 This Daitya cannot be enlivened because he has been killed by Śiva in the battle. Those killed in battle by Śiva never return to life. <br>
                                35 Still, knowing the eternal Dharma that those who seek refuge should be protected, I shall resuscitate him urged by pity. <br>
                                36 After saying this and restoring him to life, O sage, that sage who was Viṣṇu the foremost among those who wield illusion vanished from the scene. <br>
                                37 Jalandhara thus revived to life by him stood up. Delighted in mind he embraced Vṛndā and kissed her face. <br>
                                38 On seeing her husband, Vṛndā too was delighted. She forgot her sorrow. She considered everything a dream. <br>
                                39 Delighted in the heart and with all the dormant passions kindled up, she sported with him for many days in the middle of that forest. <br>
                                40 <b>Once at the end of the sexual intercourse she realised that it was Viṣṇu. Vṛndā rebuked him angrily and spoke thus.</b> <br>
                                41 <b>Fie on this misdeed of Viṣṇu in outraging the modesty of another man's wife. I have now realised you as the wielder of illusion, appearing in the guise of an ascetic.</b> <br>
                                46 <b>After saying this, Vṛndā entered fire</b> though prevented by Viṣṇu who was fascinated by her charms. <br>
                                51 Viṣṇu thought of Vṛndā remorsefully. The smoke and dust from her funeral pyre covered his face. He stood there itself without any peace of mind though urged and consoled by hosts of gods and Siddhas.

                                25 Vṛndā too was extremely delighted in her mind on seeing her husband once again. Staying within the forest in his company for many days, she sported about. <br>

                                25 <b>Being deprived of his wisdom, sense of decency and discernment, by her, and overcome with erotic passions evoked by her, he lost his sense of shame and approached her even while (his divine consort) Pārvatī stood gazing.</b> <br>
                                26 Seeing him approaching, she, being stripped of clothes, became extremely abashed. She concealed herself behind the tree laughing but did not linger (anywhere). <br>
                                27 <b>The divine Śiva whose senses (control of mind) were robbed away (by the damsel) and was overpowered by passions, pursued her as the leader of elephant would follow a she-elephant.</b> <br>
                                28 <b>Running after her with great speed, and seizing her by the locks of her hair, he dragged her near him and hugged her in his arms, despite her unwillingness.</b> <br>
                                29 Being closely embraced by god Śiva, like unto a she-elephant by an elephant, she wriggled to and fro (within his arms) and got her hair dishevelled. <br>
                                30 Having extricated herself from the arms of the great god, she ran away fast, despite her big hips, as she was the Māyā (deluding potency) created by the Lord, Oh dear king. <br>
                                31 Being completely overwhelmed with passion, like that by his enemy, the above-described Rudra followed the footsteps of the damsel, created by Lord Viṣṇu of miraculous exploits. <br>
                                32 While running after her, the semen of Śiva of unfailing procreative capacity, went on escaping like that of a big bull-leader of a herd pursuing a fecundable Cow or as that of a rutting leader-elephant running after a fertilizable she-elephant. <br>
                                33 Oh ruler of the earth! The various places on earth where the seed of that great-souled god fell, became the areas of silver and gold ores. <br>
                                34 Thus in the course of his pursuit (of the damsel), god Śiva was found (pursuing her) on the banks of the rivers and lakes on the mountains, in forests and gardens and whereever sages lived. <br>
                                35 When his semen was completely escaped, he realized that he had been befooled by the Māyā of God Viṣṇu and he recovered himself completely from that delusion, Oh great king.

                            Shiva is portrayed here as being duped by Vishnu. But this deception causes him to be a predator. Therefore, Vishnu could be said to bear culpability for what happened here as well.

                                29 His sons, the sages, of whom Marīci was the foremost, saw that their father had set his heart on unrighteousness. Out of familiar confidence, they pleaded with (lit. awakened) him. <br>
                                30 "That you do not control your passion despite your capacity to do so, and that you are bent on approaching your daughter, has never been done by the ancestors nor will it be done by others after you in future. <br>

                            The Hindu deities are humanized, fallen conceptualizations of the divine. They are often described as petty and violent. And, in this case, their crimes are truly reprehensible, as they prey on women out of lust.
