                            The Hindu practice of Sati or Suttee, wherein a woman, after the death of her husband, would be burned alive on her husband's funeral pyre, was primarily practiced in India during the period 500-1800 AD. Today, it is illegal, and condemned, but for hundreds of years, Hindu widows died in this disturbing manner, often compelled by their family members.

                            Sati is explicitly advocated for in Hindu scripture, as the duty of a woman, which if performed, would result in reward:

                                It has been established on the testimony of European eye-witnesses that at the beginning of the nineteenth century, at any rate, force was used to prevent the victims from escaping from the burning pyre. Mr. J. Peggs published a booklet under the name of "The Suttee's cry to Britain" in which he wrote: <br> <br>
                                
                                "The use of force by means of bamboos is, we believe, universal through Bengal. In the burning of widows as practised at present in some parts of Hindustan, however voluntary the widow may have been in her determination, force is employed in the act of immolation. After she has circumambulated and ascended the pile, several natives leap on it, and pressing her down on the wood, bind her with two or three ropes to the corpse of her husband, and instantly throw over the two bodies, thus bound to each other, several large bamboos, which being firmly fixed to the ground on both sides of the pile, prevent the possibility of her extricating herself when the flames reach her. Logs of wood are also thrown on the pile, which is then inflamed in an instant."

                                At Lahor I saw a most beautiful young widow sacrificed, who could not, I think, have been more than twelve years of age. The poor little creature appeared more dead than alive when she approached the dreadful pit: the agony of her mind cannot be described; she trembled and wept bitterly; but three or four of the Brahmens, assisted by an old woman who held her under the arm, forced the unwilling victim toward the fatal spot, seated her on the wood, tied her hands and feet, lest she should run away, and in that situation the innocent creature was burnt alive. I found it difficult to repress my feelings and to prevent their bursting forth into clamorous and unavailing rage; but restrained by prudential considerations, I contented myself with silently lamenting the abominable superstition of these people.

It was his daughter who was married to prince Umra, and who, though only seventeen, withstood all solicitation to save her from the pyre on his demise. I made use of the strongest arguments, through her uncle, then at Oodipoor, promising to use my influence to increase his estate, and doubtless his poverty reinforced his inclination; but all was in vain - she determined "to expiate the sins of her lord." Having remained two or three days, we continued our journey in quest of the antique and the picturesque, and found both.

                                Still, <i>Akbarnama</i> mentions that Sati is an ancient custom of Indian in which a woman immolates herself; however, unwilling she may be. Even Biruni (973-1048 AD) says that the king's wives were immolated with or without their consent. We can conclude that Sati was compulsory in some parts of India and voluntary in others.
