                                18 O holy lord, this is the evil practice of all of us, women, that we resort to sinful men casting off all shame and shyness. <br>
                                35 <b>Ever since the five elements, the world, the men and women were created by Brahmā, O Nārada, the defect lies in women always.</b> <br>
                                36 (Sanatkumāra said) On hearing her words Nārada was satisfied in his mind. Considering it to be the truth he became disinterested in them. <br>
                                37 O Vyāsa, thus the nature of women as mentioned by Pañcacūḍā has been narrated to you. What other cause of detachment do you wish to hear?
