                            In addition to the Puranas getting the sun and moon's size relative to each other wrong, they also get the absolute sizes of each wrong, if "yojanas" is to have any normative meaning. A "yojana" is traditionally said to be around 10 miles. This would mean the sun, at 9,000 yojonas, would be around 90,000 miles in diameter (actual size 865,000 miles), and the moon, at twice the diameter of the sun, would be 18,000 yojanas, or 180,000 miles (actual size 2,159 miles).

                            Therefore, this is another instance of scientific error in Hindu scripture.
