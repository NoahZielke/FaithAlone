                            The above can be framed in different ways, however, what cannot be reasonably denied is that he is putting forth a negative view of female monks/nuns (<i>Bhikkhunis</i>), wherein their existence is responsible for the potential dissolution of good teaching at twice the rate it would have dissolved otherwise. That is, he appears to be ascribing a theological deficiency to women on the basis of their gender.

                            Then the Venerable Anuruddha approached the Blessed One,

                            the human, I see that women, with the breakup of the body,

                            midday she dwells at home with a mind obsessed by envy. (3)

                            sensual lust. When she possesses these three qualities, with the
                            breakup of the body, after death, a woman is reborn in the plane
                            of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell."

                            If Buddha said these things, then it seems that he held a generally negative, disparaging view of women. After he began his religious life, Buddha himself was a celibate monk, who required his full-time disciples to be celibate as well. Therefore, women to him apparently seemed like a chief temptation, and it is obvious that he viewed them primarily through that lens, which apparently led to some resentment.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            If, on the other hand, these sayings were invented by early the followers of Buddha, then those followers saw no problem in adding to what their master was supposed to have said, even if he did not say it, and also held a generally negative, disparaging view of women.
