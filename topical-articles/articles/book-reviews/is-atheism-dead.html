                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Eric Metaxas is an author, radio host, and Yale University graduate. This book attempts to demonstrate the absurdity of Atheism based on increasing scientific evidence for fine-tuning, and the complexity of life. It also aims to establish the historicity of the Bible, by examining archaeological evidence. Finally, it offers a general critique of Atheism.

                            This is a very well-written, and thoughtful book. It is also quite long, so without further ado...

                            Chapter 1 - <i>In the Beginning Was the Big Bang</i>, begins with a short history on the Big Bang theory, beginning with Einstein publishing a paper in 1915 AD, whose equations indicated that the universe was expanding. These equations were confirmed by the observations of Arthur Eddington, who proved that light is affected by gravity during a solar eclipse in 1919 AD. A Russian physicist named Alexander Friedmann further demonstrated that the universe was expanding, based on Einstein's physics, in 1922 AD, and this was yet further proven in 1927 AD by the Belgian Georges Lema√Ætre. Then Edwin Hubble, who had first observed the universe expanding as early as 1924 AD, published his observational findings in 1929 AD, which confirmed what physics had already predicated.

                            Chapter 2 - <i>Where Science Cannot Go: The Big Bang and Other Singularities</i>, begins by noting that at first, the Big Bang theory was met with opposition, because it indicated that the universe had a beginning, which removed the Naturalist's crutch of appealing to infinite time to explain our existence.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            This chapter then details how black holes are created from massive stars, which, after reaching the end of their lifespan, compress under the force of their own gravity. The gravitational pull is so strong for the largest stars, that even light itself cannot escape, and consequently, a black hole is observed. These eventually collapse into <i>singularities</i>, in which the laws of physics do not necessarily apply, due to the intensity of the gravitational force. This theory, which was well-known by the 1960's AD, gave credence to the Big Bang, which was also thought to be the result of a singularity, containing the entire universe.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Next, this chapter covers how physicist Bob Dickie predicted, based on the huge amount of heat present in the early universe just after the Big Bang, that there would still be evidence of that heat, dispersed throughout the universe. This background radiation was discovered in 1964 AD, by two radio antenna operators at Bell Labs. Metaxas notes that this discovery was popularly seen as the death-knell for the Steady State model, which had proposed an eternal universe.

                            Chapter 3 - <i>The Fine-Tuned Planet</i>, discusses conditions which <i>had</i> to be precisely as they are in order for life to be possible on earth. Metaxas gives many examples.

                                If Earth were any smaller, our magnetic field would be weaker, and what we call the "solar wind" would quickly strip our atmosphere down to almost nothing, so that we would end up like Mars, which is of course a lifeless world. <br><br>

                                But if Earth were any larger, we would have other life-killing problems. In their book The Privileged Planet, authors Guillermo Gonzalez and Jay Richards explain that a larger Earth would have more powerful gravity, so that no water or methane or carbon dioxide could escape our atmosphere, which would be so thick we couldn't breathe. Our air would be more "viscous." According to Gonzalez and Richards: "Earth may be almost as big as a terrestrial planet can get."

                                But whoever would have dreamt that the presence in our solar system of the so-called "gas giants," Jupiter and Saturn, was just as crucial? After all, why should these colossally large and very distant planets have any bearing on whether life here could exist? And yet we now know that is the case, and it's one more thing we didn't know back when Carl Sagan was making his overconfident predictions. It turns out that Jupiter and Saturn - like planetary linebackers - run interference for us. In other words, if they weren't where they are, our planet would endlessly be pelted with meteorites and asteroids. Perhaps a thousand times as many would make it to our surface.

                                The size of our moon was outrageously large when compared to other moons in our solar system. But anything at all smaller would not have been sufficient to stabilize the wobble of our axis, as it has done ever since and is doing now. But science tells us that the moon's stabilization of our axis is another unavoidable prerequisite for an environment where life could exist. For example, it enables us to have just the right seasonal variation, with seasons mild enough that the temperature does not fluctuate wildly, which would make life impossible.

                                Our solar system is located on the inner edge of the Orion Arm of our galaxy, about twenty-six thousand light-years from the center. Science now understands that this is crucial to life on Earth in several ways. If we were closer to the galaxy's center, the radiation hitting us would be far greater, because there are many more stars in the galaxy's center than out here on the spiral arms where we exist. So at the center there are more "active galactic nucleus outbursts" (AGNs), as well as more supernovae and more gamma ray bursts. That would make life here impossible. We would also be far more likely to be hit by comets, which are more numerous. <br><br>
                                
                                But if we were farther out from the center, there would be other problems. Stars farther out are orbited by planets significantly smaller than Earth, so as we have said, that would mean no atmosphere capable of supporting life. Neither would they be able to sustain plate tectonics, which is another element absolutely crucial to life as we know it that we will touch on in Chapter Five.

                                At certain early epochs in cosmic history, [the universe's] mass density must have been as finely tuned as one part in 10 to the 60th power to allow for the possible existence of physical life at any time or place with the entirety of the universe. This degree of fine-tuning is so great that it's as if right after the universe beginning someone could have destroyed the possibility of life within it by subtracting a single dime's mass from the whole of the observable universe or adding a single dime's mass to it.

A universe consisting only of hydrogen would not allow for life to exist. But in case that's not impressive enough, we should say if that same strong nuclear force were just 0.3 percent stronger than it is, it would also be disastrous. It would cause protons and neutrons to attract each other too much, so that they would pile up and create only large nuclei, such as are found in heavier elements. So there would be no hydrogen at all, and any universe without hydrogen is just as useless as a universe with only hydrogen. No life could exist.

But if it were slightly stronger, they would never budge from their original orbits.... <br> <br>

                                But more impressive by far than the calibration of each of the four forces is the perfect calibration of the ratios between them.

But for such a variety of stars to exist depends on the ratio between the gravitational force and the electromagnetic force. As you may have guessed, this just happens to be perfectly fine-tuned. The ratio between them must be exact, down to one part in ten to the fortieth power.

                                The American Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning physicist Steven Weinberg is an atheist with a particular disdain for religion. Before he was able to accept the Big Bang, he admitted that the Steady State theory was "philosophically the most attractive theory because it least resembles the account given in Genesis." But Weinberg nonetheless admits that life "as we know it would be impossible if any one of several physical quantities had slightly different values," as we have been saying. But nothing we have mentioned can compare to the number Weinberg has determined to be the most fine-tuned constant yet discovered. In talking about the energy density of the universe - what is often referred to as the "cosmological constant" - he gives us the most extravagantly grotesque number of them all, in the most confounding example of fine-tuning. Weinberg says that if the value of this cosmological constant were different by just one part in 10 to the 120th power, life could not exist.

Metaxas discusses many remarkable properties of water, for instance, that unlike nearly everything else in nature, water gets 9% <i>less</i> dense when it freezes, which allows it to float. However, it actually does get <i>more</i> dense when cooling, until it gets to 39 degrees, whereupon it reverses, and begins getting less dense. Without this property, life on earth could not exist:

                                For example, if ice did not float, lakes and other bodies of water would freeze from the bottom up, completely destroying their ecosystems - or never developing them in the first place. But because ice floats, it forms on the surfaces of lakes and ponds and rivers and arctic oceans. If it froze from the bottom up it would cause a runaway freezing of all the water above it. And because it floats on the top, it even creates an insulation barrier for the water beneath it, protecting it from the cold above the ice, and allowing the life beneath to survive.

Metaxas then introduces James Tour, a chemist and nanoscientist who is involved in origin of life debates. Tour notes two issues which have made Abiogenesis seem <i>less</i> likely since Miller-Urey, which will be covered in the succeeding chapter - the increasing understanding of the complexity of the cell, and the awareness that deep time is actually a <i>problem</i> for Abiogenesis, rather than a necessary aid.

                                Meyer calculates the odds of a single functional protein - or a single functional gene - coming into existence via random processes based "upon recent experiments in molecular biology establishing the extreme rarity of functional proteins in relation to the total number of possible arrangements of amino acids corresponding to a protein of a given length." And what did he find? Essentially that the odds of this ever having occurred are so astronomically low we can once and for all be certain that it never happened. To put it in his own words, "the probability of producing even a single functional protein of modest length (150 amino acids) by chance alone in a prebiotic environment stands at no better than a ‚Äòvanishingly small' [one] chance in ten to the 164th power." That is, of course, one chance in one followed by 164 zeroes. In other words: it didn't happen. <br> <br>

                                Of course Meyer was only calculating what it would take for one single functioning protein to come into being. But the simplest living cell contains hundreds of specialized proteins, all performing their own tasks.

Many of the chemicals needed are kinetic products, meaning they are not thermodynamically stable. For example, carbohydrates - the main class of compounds - are the units that hook together DNA. These are the units that have identifying aspects on cell structure; these are the units that the cell is going to need for the energy of life. But once they form they begin to decompose. Tour says "unless somebody is there... to fish them out, to stop the process, and put them in a bottle under inert conditions in a freezer," they go away as quickly as they came into being. <br> <br>
                                
                                Tour explains there are many other similar problems. For example, if random processes somehow succeeded in miraculously creating a carbohydrate or another necessary compound, the random processes don't know how to do it again. They have no capacity to "learn." If they happen to hit it just right by accident, they have no ability to say, "Let's try that again!" Tour says: <br> <br>
                                
                                Say it took you four hundred million years to get to a certain point on a synthesis, [but] now you have to go back and make more. But how do you go back and make more? Nature never kept a laboratory notebook.... So even if it could make more, it doesn't know how to, so it's got to start all over again. But it doesn't know how to. [It] doesn't know why to start over again because it doesn't know what it's going toward.

                                The chemicals decompose.... The ammonia environment and cell itself is quite basic. You're going to have extended Aldol reactions coming on. So to think that the molecules could be made and sit there waiting for other molecules to come in, it doesn't happen. Organic chemistry doesn't work that way. Any student that is lazy enough to set up reactions and likes to go home for the weekend without working them up pays the price for that. With a depressed yield, generally.... As soon as the reactions are done or as soon as what you want is the optimized yield, you have to stop that reaction and get it away from the starting materials or else what happens is it goes on to polymerize product. Especially when you're making kinetic products, which is not the thermodynamically most stable product, which is exactly what you get in many of the chemicals that are needed for life.

                                So we know that the Hittites existed, and in such height and breadth as the greatest of any civilizations. But the Bible alone held their name aloft through the darkness of three millennia, until at long last the new fields of archaeology and philology could catch up with it. Those who clung to the Bible as a source of inerrant truth in all matters - whether geographical or historical or other - had in the story of the Hittites been vindicated once more.

It was written by the Mesha mentioned in 2 Kings 3:4. It also mentions King Omri - "Omri was king of Israel", and directly mentions the name of God, Yahweh.

First discussed are the Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in 1947 AD, located in jars placed in caves near the Dead Sea. There were nearly 1,000 scrolls, many of which were Hebrew Scriptures - 37 of the 39 books of the Old Testament were represented. Many of the scrolls dated from during and before the time of Christ, and verified that our Old Testament text was faithfully preserved.

                                Approximately 5,000 Greek manuscripts, containing all or part of the New Testament, exist.

Besides this, virtually the entire New Testament could be reproduced from citations contained in the works of the early church fathers. There are some thirty-two thousand citations in the writings of the Fathers prior to the Council of Nicea (325 AD).... <br> <br>

                                Many of the manuscripts are early-for example, the John Rylands manuscript (about 120 AD; it was found in Egypt and contains a few verses from the Gospel of John), the Chester Beatty Papyri (200 AD; it contains major portions of the New Testament), Codex Sinaiticus (350 AD; it contains virtually all of the New Testament), and Codex Vaticanus (325‚Äì50 AD; it contains almost the entire Bible).

                                Somewhere in Eastern Europe, an SS officer watched languidly, his machine gun cradled, as an elderly and bearded Hasidic Jew laboriously dug what he knew to be his grave.

                                So however such apologists for atheist murders might hope to deflect us, we must press on. The murder's the thing. It is so well documented as to be starkly beyond dispute. There is simply no way to escape this indictment other than to ignore it by shouting anything else as loudly as possible. But if we are interested not merely in facts but in truth, we cannot be distracted. We cannot ignore it. Because these are telling facts, telling of an inhumanity beyond imagining, telling of the sky-scraping evil of a world without God. <br> <br>
                                
                                Of course numbers like 150 million people are so huge and so abstract that they can be numbing. So let's be more specific. In the year 1937 alone, the dedicatedly atheistic Soviets murdered 106,300 clergymen. They hoped this would help in eradicating the evil of Christian religion. If you ever have been in a stadium capable of holding this many persons you will have some idea of what the most evil regime in the history of the world is capable, and in the space of a single calendar year. And of course this was only the number of clergymen whom the Soviets murdered in that year. It is a level of wickedness that must take the breath of any sensitive human being away but is of course merely a fraction of the far wider evil done in the name of eradicating "religion" by violent means. The Soviets - in the course of their adoption of what they called "scientific atheism" - murdered between twelve and twenty million human beings.

                                This is of course one of the things about so-called deathbed conversions. As much as they are often discounted as fearful and desperate leapings toward some chimera, they are often the opposite. Dr. Samuel Johnson famously said: "When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully." The conversion of someone close to death is often evidence that they at last had the ability to think clearly, with none of the distractions of life, such as having to face friends who disagree with you or having to give up some of the things you fear turning to God might mean giving up.

                                So even today in the so-called free cultures of the West, where freedom of speech and religious liberty are enshrined in our laws, we know that it's not that simple, that there are cultural forces at play that still have the power to shut most of us up. Will you let them? <br> <br>
                                
                                Because as it happens, you have power, too. You have the power to speak the truth or to be silent. But if you don't speak the truth when you are able, you yourself become complicit in the false paradigm. Will you participate in silencing the truth? And if you are quiet about what you know to be true, are you not perhaps worse than those who genuinely don't know it to be true?

                            This book was fantastic - especially Part I, which included a lot of scientific fine-tuning data. Each of the three parts come together to make a very compelling case against a Materialistic worldview, and for the trustworthiness of the Bible. Everything is well-written, and most of the points Metaxas makes are compelling.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Be aware that Metaxas writes from an Old Earth perspective, although most of his points stand totally independent of that viewpoint, and can be used just as well by Young Earth believers.
