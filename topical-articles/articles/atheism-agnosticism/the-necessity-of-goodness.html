                            In the essay <a href="../books/why-im-not-an-atheist.html" target="_blank">Why I'm Not an Atheist</a>, the proposition that an intelligent God exists was defended using natural observations and some light philosophical argumentation. This will be a short follow-up work intended to explore the logical implications of an intelligent God existing.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            If God is intelligent - the most intelligent agent in existence - then He knows, and can demonstrate better than any other agent, the superiority of good over evil. Here, "good" would represent things like mercy, justice, compassion, and goodwill toward others. Intelligence is what demonstrates the objective superiority of these attributes over their opposites. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            For instance, it is not the case that justice is simply <i>arguably</i> better than injustice. It is instead an absolute fact that justice is superior to injustice, and any intelligent agent such as God is would be able to demonstrate that fact with piercing clarity, and dogmatic certainty. This is not merely an opinion or preference, or what some intelligent agents happen to enjoy. Rather, in a world in which all of the facts are laid bare, and every detail is accounted for, it is demonstrably provable that it is superior to be just than it is to be unjust, because justice is always logical, and reasonable, whereas injustice is always illogical and unreasonable.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Therefore, because God exists, and is intelligent, by necessity, every single wrong will be accounted for, and rectified. There logically cannot be even a single injustice which is allowed to go unrectified, or slip through the cracks, or to be unaccounted for. God would not be God if such a thing were possible. The echoes of injustice would ring for all of eternity in His very nature, and His own wisdom would become His perpetual torment - all of which is nonsense when speaking of a Being such as God. It is as impossible and illogical as a square triangle, or a married bachelor.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This conclusion is nothing more than the result of God having perfect moral discernment. No one needs to lecture God on the sleights and injustices going on in His universe. He is aware of it all, and holds it all with perfect clarity in a mind which misses no details. He is aware of every motivation, every action, every thought, and every outcome. He has missed nothing, and not a single detail has escaped Him. And, given that God must know - with greater precision than any other agent - the superiority of rectification, and restoration, and empathy, and goodwill toward others, He will necessarily rectify His creation in a way that is not merely "good", but super-abounding in goodness, and that for every single agent that has ever come into existence. It will not merely "hopefully" be a "pretty good" outcome, but instead, must absolutely and necessarily be the best outcome, and the most wonderful outcome for all involved. It must heal all wounds and brokenness, restore for every lost opportunity, remember every forgotten act of virtue, and bring all into perfect fellowship with Himself. These things, in every case, are better than their alternatives. Rationally, they represent the best possible scenario, which God always and inevitably works toward.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In summary, there <i>must</i> be perfect restoration, given the nature of God. His nature guarantees it in an absolute way. And, it will be a restoration which will abound beyond what any person can imagine, because it will necessarily be the best, and most good, and most merciful restoration that could possibly be imagined. 
                        </p>
