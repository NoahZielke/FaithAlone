                            The argument for a creator God from the impossibility of infinite causal chains, using a person as an example, is:

                            <li>Suppose there is a person, John, at an arbitrary point in a causal chain, x</li>
                            <li>In order for the atoms that comprise John's body to be where they are at point x, there had to be forces acting on them at x - 1, which account for their current location. In order for the atoms that comprise John's body to be where they are at x - 1, there had to be forces acting on them at x - 2. And so on</li>
                            <li>Suppose this causal chain is infinite</li>
                            <li>Then, John is a product of a sequence of events represented by: x - ∞, x - (∞ - 1), x - (∞ - 2), ..., x - 1, x</li>
                            <li>But it is impossible to reach x from x - ∞, as no matter how many events take place after x - ∞, the infinite series will never be traversed</li>
                            <li>Therefore, John must be a product of a sequence of events represented by: x - n, x - (n - 1), x - (n - 2), ..., x - 1, x, where n is some finite number, or else his existence would be a logical impossibility, as his atoms never would have reached their current arrangement. And, x - n represents the point at which an uncaused, first cause, God, created the universe</li>
                        </ol>
                        <!-- Even if at various points in the chain, the atoms are quarks and electrons, or something else, that would still be a point in the causal chain, requiring a preceding cause. So, really it's "forces acting on what would become John's atoms" -->

                            Something had to have happened to our atoms (forces acting on them) in order to get them into this arrangement. If we could re-wind that sequence, then we would be effectively "go back in time". But we could not logically rewind forever. Otherwise, how could this reality, in which our atoms have had those forces act on them to the extent that they have, to get us to this point, exist

                            The argument from infinite yesterdays (Trent Horn) - See screenshots on 6/20/24 - Time had to have had a starting point, from which we could return to by marching backwards in a series of yesterdays. If not, we could never have arrived at today, because if our yesterdays were infinite, we could never have stepped through them all to now. And how can there be act without time? What, in our materialistic universe, could operate? Operation, in the natural word, requires time, because *that's how time is defined*. 
                            
                            Stated another way: Time had to have a beginning. Otherwise we never would've arrived at today. But since we are here, we know that a finite number of yesterdays took place. If the yesterdays were infinite, we never would've gotten to now

                            Also, there is the consideration that if infinitely much time had passed, the universe would be too disordered for anything to take place - entropy would be maximum, and no energy would be usable

                            There had to have been finite time behind us for us to be talking right now. If it were infinite, we never would have gotten to now

                            This all needs to be considered in light of the B theory of time. Not everything is moving at the speed of light. In fact, it would take infinite (?) energy to accelerate mass to the speed of light. So the atoms that constitute my body could not be eternal, because then they wouldn't have gotten to this form, at this time. They'd be in another form. 

                            -> B Theory only makes sense if the subjective past was finite, from the point of view of the atoms that compose my body
                            - I appear to be a proponent of finite-block B Theory, with the Big Bang beginning the block

                            Even if there was an infinite chain of cause and effect, that infinite chain would still need a first cause outside the chain altogether
