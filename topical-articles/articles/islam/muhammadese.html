                            One of the most evident proofs that the Quran is fraudulent is the fact that Muhammad, when recounting "dialogue" in the Quran, made everyone in history sound exactly the same, and exactly like him - even maintaining his Arabic rhyming schemes in their speech. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This article will cover a few examples of this phenomenon.

                        <h3>Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Ending a sentence with "Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful" is something Muhammad does dozens of times in the Quran. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            For instance:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Surah 2:192</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                192 But if they cease, then <b>surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</b>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Other instances of Muhammad using this to end his sentences would be Surah 2:173, 2:182, 2:192, 2:199, 2:218, 2:226, 3:31, 3:89, 3:129, 4:16, 4:23, 4:25, 4:96, 4:100, 4:106, 4:110, 4:129, 4:152, 5:3, 5:34, 5:39, 5:74, 5:98, 6:54, 6:145, 6:165, 7:153, 7:167, 8:69-70, 9:5, 9:27, 9:91, 9:99, 9:102, 10:107, 15:49, 16:18, 16:110, 16:115, 16:119, 24:5, 24:22, 24:33, 24:62, 25:6, 25:70, 27:11, 28:16, 33:5, 33:24, 33:50, 33:59, 33:78, 39:53, 41:32, 42:5, 46:8, 48:14, 49:5, 49:14, 57:28, 58:12, 60:7, 60:12, 64:14, 66:1, and 73:20.

                            However, according to Muhammad, <i>everyone</i> else used to do this as well, as the Quran records Noah, Abraham, Jacob, and Potiphar's wife, using that exact same Arabic phrase to end their sentences too: 
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>

                                41 And he said, “Board it! In the Name of Allah it will sail and cast anchor. <b>Surely my Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” </b>
                            </p>

                                33 Allah said, “O Adam! Inform them of their names.” Then when Adam did, Allah said, “Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the <b>heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you conceal?”</b>

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Muhammad, when composing the Quran, made everyone else speak just like him, and even maintain his Arabic rhyming schemes when they spoke, which were found nowhere in history prior to the Quran. Not a single prophet, in prior Scripture, sounded anything like he made them sound in the Quran, and no one ended all of their statements with his same vague exaltations of God, which he includes everywhere, even when they make no sense.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This is one of the clearest proofs that Muhammad simply invented dialogue, and put words in the mouths of others, in an attempt to make it seem as though he was following in the footsteps of the great prophets of the Bible. Muslims must keep in mind, however, that this all stands on the testimony of Muhammad alone, as he is the only source in human history which records all of these figures speaking in the same manner that he spoke. This is because the people he attempted to hijack for his religion did not actually speak this way, neither did they say the things that he often put into their mouths.
