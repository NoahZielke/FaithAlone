                            Mut'ah marriage, literally "pleasure marriage", in Islam, refers to a practice that Muhammad apparently allowed in the early days of Islam, in which men were allowed to temporarily "marry" a woman, and then divorce her. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The primary sources for this practice are narrations such as:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Sahih al-Bukhari 4615</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                Narrated Abdullah: <br>
                                We used to participate in the holy wars carried on by the Prophet (ﷺ) and we had no women (wives) with us. So we said (to the Prophet (ﷺ)). "Shall we castrate ourselves?" But the Prophet (ﷺ) forbade us to do that, and thenceforth <b>he allowed us to marry a woman (temporarily) by giving her even a garment,</b> and then he recited: "O you who believe! Do not make unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you." (5:87)
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Notice that the above, Muhammad appeals to a verse in the Quran to justify his allowance of "temporary marriage":
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Surah 5:87</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                87 <b>O believers! Do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful for you,</b> and do not transgress. Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors.
                            </p>

                            Therefore, a sound case can be made that Muhammad not only allowed temporary marriage - which is prostitution in every sense, save in name only - but also called it a "good thing", as the above speaks of "the good things which Allah has made lawful for you". 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Muhammad's endorsement of this practice is also recorded in Sahih al-Bukhari 5075, 5117-18, Sahih Muslim 1404a-c, 1405a-b, and Sunan Ibn Majah 1962.

                            Later, he went on to ban the practice, on the same day he banned the meat of domestic donkeys (Sahih al-Bukhari 5115, 5523, 6961, Sahih Muslim 1404b, 1405f, 1406a-l, 1407a-e):  
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Sahih al-Bukhari 4216</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                Narrated Ali bin Abi Talib: <br>
                                On the day of Khaibar, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade the Mut'a (i.e. temporary marriage) and the eating of donkey-meat.

                            Or, according to some, it was allowed for Muhammad's entire life, and then Umar banned it (Sahih Muslim 1249, 1405c-e). Either way, the Sunni narrations are unanimous in stating that Muhammad allowed this practice during the early days of Islam.

He (the Imam) said, 'Allah has made it lawful in His book by the tongue of His Holy prophet, O Allah, grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to Your cause, <b>thus it will remain lawful up to the Day of Judgment.'</b> He then said, 'O abu Ja'far, how can someone like you say this, when 'Umar made it unlawful and prohibited it?' He (the Imam) said, 'Even if he has done so.' He said, 'I ask Allah to protect you against a thing that 'Umar has made unlawful.'

He (the Imam) said, <b>'Yes, it is permissible, as many times as he wants; it is not like a free woman. She is hired and her case is similar to slave-girls.'"</b>

                            In the scenario described above, a woman is essentially being treated as a prostitute, being exploited by multiple men in "temporary marriages".

                            Mut'ah marriage, which is a form of prostitution, and is prohibited in the Bible (Leviticus 19:29, Deuteronomy 23:17, Matthew 5:32, Ephesians 5:5, etc.). By allowing this practice, Muhammad demonstrated himself not to be in the line of the Biblical prophets.
