                            Muhammad famously denied that Jesus Christ ever died, instead saying that "it was only made to appear so", and "Allah raised Him up to himself":
                        </p>

                                157 And for boasting, “We killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.” But they neither killed nor crucified him - it was only made to appear so. Even those who argue for this ˹crucifixion˺ are in doubt. They have no knowledge whatsoever - only making assumptions. They certainly did not kill him. <br>
                                158 Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.

                            Even though this contradicts the words of the Jesus Christ when He repeatedly prophesied His own death (Matthew 12:40, 16:21, 17:11-12, 17:22-23, 20:17-19, 20:22-23, 20:28, 21:33-46, 26:1-2, Mark 8:31, 9:12, 9:31, 10:32-34, 10:38-39, 10:45, 12:1-12, Luke 9:22, 17:24-25, 18:31-33, 20:9-19, John 2:19-22, 3:14-16, 10:15-18, 12:32-33), even though it contradicts the testimony of all the early Christians and secular witnesses (1 Corinthians 15:3-8: 1 Peter 3:18, etc., Josephus, Tacitus), even though it contradicts the symbol of the Last Supper that He implemented for His followers forever, which was unanimously practiced by the earliest Christians (Luke 22:19: 1 Corinthians 11:23-27), and even though it means that there should have been no such thing as a Christian in the first place, because the New Testament only began with the death of Christ (Hebrews 9:15-21, Matthew 26:26-28, Mark 14:22-24, Luke 22:17-20), perhaps the strongest witness against Muhammad's claim is the fact that there are Old Testament prophecies of Jesus dying, some of which also include the resurrection. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The witness of the Old Testament matters, because there are extant manuscripts of it from before Jesus Christ lived, and even Jews who reject Jesus affirm that the Christian Old Testament is authentic. Therefore, it cannot be dismissed as "corruption by the Apostle Paul", or other similarly-absurd claims that are often resorted to by Muslim apologists. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>1. The Protoevangelium</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The first reference to the death of Jesus Christ in Scripture is in the original promise of the Messiah - the chosen seed of the woman who would crush the head of the serpent - just after Adam and Eve sinned in the Garden of Eden:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Genesis 3:14-15</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: <br>
                                15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, <b>and thou shalt bruise his heel.</b>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Verse 15 says that though the chosen seed will "crush (the serpent's) head", the serpent would "bruise His heel" - that is, victory achieved in spite of anguish.  
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            When Jesus Christ died, and rose from the dead, He ultimately conquered death (1 Corinthians 15:20-28), which crushed the head of the serpent: 
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Hebrews 2:14</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; <b>that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</b>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This victory will be fully realized with the final destruction of the Devil (Ezekiel 28:13-19, Revelation 20:10), and death itself, forever (Revelation 21:4). 
                        </p>
                        <h3>2. Abraham Sacrificing Isaac</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The next reference to the death of Christ is one of the most explicit in the entire Bible, and that is when God tells Abraham to sacrifice his "only son" Isaac:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Genesis 22:1-13</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. <br>
                                2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. <br>
                                3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. <br>
                                4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. <br>
                                5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. <br>
                                6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. <br>
                                7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? <br>
                                8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together. <br>
                                9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. <br>
                                10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. <br>
                                11 And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. <br>
                                12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. <br>
                                13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Notice especially that even though Abraham already had another son named Ishmael, three times in this chapter God calls Isaac his "only son" (Genesis 22:2, 22:12, 22:16). Why? 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Firstly, because God was creating a picture with Ishmael and Isaac which would be fulfilled in the New Covenant, over 2,000 years later, as explained in Galatians 4:22-31. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Secondly, because God was pointing to the sacrifice of His "only begotten Son" (John 3:16). Notice that: 
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Abraham lays the wood upon Isaac before they go up the mountain (Genesis 22:6) - an utterly irrelevant detail, without the parallel to Christ carrying His cross up mount Calvary</li>
                            <li>Abraham tells Isaac that "God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering"</li>
                            <li>A ram used to take the place of Isaac is "caught in a thicket by his horns". This also pictures Jesus Christ, who had branches from thorn bushes wrapped around His head to form a mock crown (Matthew 27:29, Mark 15:17, John 19:2)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Also notice that Abraham's prophecy of God providing a "lamb" was not fulfilled here. A ram is a different animal, and a different Hebrew word is used. This is because Abraham was referring to "The Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world" (John 1:29) - a title given to Christ years before His death, by John the Baptist.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Abraham also knew that if God had allowed him to sacrifice Isaac, that He would raise Isaac from the dead, and that this would be a figure of what was to come (Hebrews 11:19). This is evidenced in the Genesis account, where Abraham, knowing what he was about to have to do, still tells his servants that he <i>and Isaac</i> will be returning from the mountain (Genesis 22:5). <!--This is why Jesus Christ said "Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it, and was glad" (John 8:56).-->

                        <h3>3. The Passover Lamb</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Next is the Passover, which is probably the clearest picture of the death of Christ in the entire Old Testament:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Exodus 12:1-13</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                1 And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying, <br>
                                2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you. <br>
                                3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: <br>
                                4 And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb. <br>
                                5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: <br>
                                6 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. <br>
                                7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it. <br>
                                8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. <br>
                                9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof. <br>
                                10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. <br>
                                11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the Lord's passover. <br>
                                12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord. <br>
                                13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Firstly, once again notice the importance of John the Baptist's designation of Jesus as "The Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world" (John 1:29, 1:35-36). The Passover was something that God instituted so that when John preached, he could use it as a symbol for the Messiah. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Secondly, notice above that a spotless male lamb - which was representative of the sinless Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 5:21) - was to be sacrificed, and its blood was to be applied to the doorpost of the house, to spare those inside from judgement. This pictures the vicarious death of Christ, which saves believers from judgment. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Thirdly, notice that the lamb was kept from the tenth day until the fourteenth day (Exodus 12:3, 12:6). This parallels Jesus's triumphal entry into Jerusalem ("presentation of the lamb") to His crucifixion 4 days later <i>during Passover week</i>, proving completely that He was the fulfillment of this picture that had been prophesying of Him for 1,500 years. This is why, in the New Testament, He is fittingly called "our Passover" (1 Corinthians 5:7).
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Fourthly, none of the bones of the Passover lamb could be broken (Exodus 12:46), and the Bible is careful to mention that none of Jesus's bones were broken during His crucifixion (John 19:36), as also prophesied in Psalm 34:20.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The symbol of the Passover was fulfilled extremely clearly in Jesus Christ. It barely needs explanation, because it is so evident.

                            The next prophetic symbol of Jesus Christ's death is God instructing Moses to smite the rock in Horeb:

                                5 And the Lord said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go. <br>
                                6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.

                            Above, the Israelites find themselves in the wilderness where there is no water source, and so they become angered at Moses (Exodus 17:3-4). God then commands Moses to hit a rock in Horeb with his staff, and it produced a water source suitable for the various needs of the Israelites.
                        </p>

                            Firstly, this event is referenced as a symbol of Jesus Christ in the New Testament, where the Apostle Paul writes that the Israelites all drank "the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: <i>and that Rock was Christ</i>" (1 Corinthians 10:4).

                            Secondly, Moses was told to "smite the rock" (Exodus 17:6), because he was picturing God the Father smiting Jesus Christ for the sins of the world:

                                5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. <br>
                                6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.

                                13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: <br>

                            Therefore, Jesus can be said to be both the rock, and the living water, in this account. He was smitten for our sins, and is also the embodiment of Everlasting Life (1 John 5:20).

                        <p class="article-body">
                            The next prophecy of Jesus Christ's death in the Old Testament is when Moses dedicates the covenant with the people at the base of Mt. Sinai:

                                7 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient. <br>
                                8 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words.

                            Here, the Old Covenant is dedicated with "the blood of the covenant", which is sprinkled on the people. Why? Why would it be sprinkled on the people?

                            It was sprinkled on them, because it was picturing being covered by the blood of Jesus Christ (Revelation 1:5). The inauguration of the Old Covenant paralleled the inauguration of the New Covenant by the death of Christ, which the Lord spoke of at the Last Supper (Matthew 26:27-28, Mark 14:23-24, Luke 22:20), and as is explained in the following passage from Hebrews chapter 9:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Hebrews 9:12-22</h5>

                                12 <b>Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</b> <br>
                                13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: <br>
                                14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? <br>
                                15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. <br>
                                16 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. <br>
                                17 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. <br>
                                18 <b>Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.</b> <br>
                                19 <b>For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</b> <br>
                                20 Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. <br>
                                21 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry. <br>
                                22 <b>And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.</b>

                            Just as the Old Covenant was dedicated with blood, so too is the New Covenant dedicated with blood. Therefore, the sacrificial, substitutionary death of the Messiah, completes another Old Testament picture, and ushered in the New Covenant - the coming of which had likewise been explicitly prophesied (Jeremiah 31:31-34, Hebrews 8:8-12).

It is for this reason that Jesus likened Himself to the serpent on the pole when He was crucified:

                                28 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.

                            Notice above that the High Priest was the one who was "anointed with holy oil" (Numbers 35:25, Leviticus 8:5-12), which is representative of the Messiah, which literally means "anointed". Christ is called our "High Priest" repeatedly in the New Testament (Hebrews 2:17, 3:1, 4:14-15, 5:10, 6:20, 7:26-28, 8:1, 9:11, 10:21).

                                2 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent. <br>
                                3 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel. <br>
                                4 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them. <br>
                                5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded. <br>
                                6 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people. <br>
                                7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, <br>
                                8 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him. <br>
                                9 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts. <br>
                                10 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly. <br>
                                11 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help. <br>
                                12 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. <br>
                                13 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion. <br>
                                14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels. <br>
                                15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. <br>
                                16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet. <br>
                                17 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me. <br>
                                18 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture. <br>
                                19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me. <br>
                                20 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog. <br>
                                21 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns. <br>
                                22 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee. <br>

                                24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard. <br>
                                25 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him. <br>
                                26 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever. <br>
                                27 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. <br>
                                28 For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the nations. <br>
                                29 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul. <br>
                                30 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation. <br>

                            Above is the entirety of Psalm 22. Jesus Christ famously called attention to this Psalm on the cross, saying "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46, Mark 15:34). On the cross, Jesus was pointing to this Psalm, and any who have read it find it to be describing exactly what was happening to Jesus Christ, at that moment.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Verses 1-5 of this Psalm serve as a kind of preamble. Verse 6 begins from the perspective of Jesus Christ, hanging on the cross. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In this section, which comprises verses 6-21, Christ is surrounded by "bulls" (verse 12), "lions" (verses 13, 21), and "dogs" (verses 16, 20) - symbolic of the assembly gathered there to crucify Him, and watch the crucifixion. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Of them, Jesus says that "All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him" (verses 7-8). This matches Jesus Christ's experience on the cross exactly. The spectators of His execution were not respectful, or timid. They railed on Him repeatedly (Matthew 27:39-44, Mark 15:29-32, Luke 23:35-39), and verse 8 is a verbatim quotation of the chief priests who were present at the crucifixion:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Matthew 27:41-43</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, <br>
                                42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. <br>
                                43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.

                            Continuing in the Psalm, Christ says that "They pierced my hands and my feet" (verse 16), which is descriptive of crucifixion in such a clear, obvious way, that it needs no explanation. Those present also "part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture" (verse 18), fulfilled to the last detail in John 19:23-24, and also mentioned in Matthew 27:35, and Luke 23:34.

                            Verses 22-26 of this Psalm then begin to describe the triumph of the Messiah, as though He was just killed, He was then ultimately saved from the power of death, three days later (see the discussion on Psalm 16:8-11 above).

                                13 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high. <br>
                                14 As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men: <br>
                                15 So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider. <br>
                                1 Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? <br>
                                2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. <br>
                                3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. <br>
                                4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. <br>
                                5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. <br>
                                6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. <br>
                                7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. <br>
                                8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. <br>
                                9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. <br>
                                10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. <br>
                                11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. <br>
                                12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

                            <li>He is going to be so badly disfigured that He is almost unrecognizable as a human (Isaiah 52:14). Correspondingly, Christ was beaten in the face (Matthew 26:67-68, Luke 22:64) and scourged before the crucifixion</li>
                            <li>He is going to "sprinkle many nations" (Isaiah 52:15). This refers to the atoning death covering all of mankind (1 John 2:2)</li>
                            <li>He is going to be rejected by His people (Isaiah 53:3-4). Of course, Christ was crucified by His people, the Jews</li>
                            <li>He is going to bear the sins of the those same people who rejected Him, and make intercession for them (Isaiah 53:4-6, 12)</li>
                            <li>He is not going to open His mouth at a fixed time before death (Isaiah 53:7), which is exactly what happened at Christ's trial (Matthew 27:11-14, Mark 15:3-5, Luke 23:9)</li>
                            <li>He is going to die a substitutionary death wherein God makes "his soul an offering for sin" (Isaiah 53:8-10), yet, He is going to gloriously rise from the dead, and see His children (Isaiah 53:10-12)</li>

                            Verse 24 above sets the expectation that "reconciliation for iniquity", and "everlasting righteousness" will be established with the 70 weeks being spoken of. The meaning of the 70 weeks is a topic that goes beyond the scope of this article, but clearly the passage breaks it into 3 units - 7 weeks, 62 weeks, and the final week, without specifying a time bound between each unit. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Verse 25 places verse 26 after the rebuilding of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. Then, verse 26 says that the end of the 7 + 62 weeks is marked by the Messiah's advent, and his being "cut off" - which refers to the death of Christ (Isaiah 53:8). And, all of this had to happen before the destruction of the Second Temple, because after the Messiah being "cut off", "the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary", which again, happened in 70 AD.

                            Therefore, this passage, which is explicitly about the Messiah, prophecies that the Messiah would be killed before the destruction of the Second Temple, which is exactly what we see in Jesus Christ.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Famously, Jonah was cast overboard to save others, and spent three days and three nights in the belly of a whale, just as Christ was dead for three days and three nights (Matthew 12:40):

                                15 <b>So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.</b> <br>
                                16 Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows. <br>
                                17 Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. <b>And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</b> <br>
                                1 Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly, <br>
                                2 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice. <br>
                                3 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. <br>
                                4 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. <br>
                                5 The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head. <br>
                                6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God. <br>
                                7 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple. <br>
                                8 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. <br>
                                9 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD. <br>
                                10 And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.

                            There are some who take the position that Jonah died in the whale's belly, which is possible. He describes himself in verse 2 as being in "Hell", i.e., the place of the dead, and in verse 6, he says he "went down to the bottoms of the mountains".
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Regardless of whether he was using parabolic language, Jonah certainly serves as a picture of Jesus Christ being dead for three days and three nights, and it was an image that Christ Himself pointed towards more than once (Matthew 12:39-40, 16:4, Luke 11:29).

                            The prophet Zechariah, speaking for the Lord, said:

                            Above, the Israelites are prophesied to "look on him whom they pierced" (John 19:37), which finds a parallel in Psalm 22:16, and a fulfillment in Christ having His hands and feet pierced by those who delivered Him up to be crucified.

                            Another reference to the death of Jesus Christ in Zechariah is the following:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Zechariah 13:7</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                7 Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: <b>smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered:</b> and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.

                            This is quoted in the New Testament explicitly, by Jesus Christ (Matthew 26:31, Mark 14:27). Of course, Jesus called himself "The Good Shepherd", and "The good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep" (John 10:11).
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This also pairs with the other already-discussed references to Christ being "smitten" (Exodus 17:6, Isaiah 53:4).

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Jesus Christ died a substitutionary death for sinners on the cross, contrary to the claims of the false prophet Muhammad. This is why He came to earth (Hebrews 2:9), and it is what He was prophesied to do, repeatedly, in the Old Testament.
