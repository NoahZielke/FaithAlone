                        <h3>Zul-Qarnain in the Quran</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In Surah 18 of the Quran, we read the story of Zul-Qarnain, literally "The two-horned one". The identity of Zul-Qarnain is contested, but it is only contested because his true identification as Alexander the Great disproves Islam, as it is known historically that Alexander the Great was a Greek Pagan, not a Muslim, as the story portrays him as. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Nevertheless, Tafsir Al-Jalalayn on Surah 18:83 identifies him as Alexander the Great. Maududi, in his Tafsir on Surah 18:83, also admits "in general the commentators have been of the opinion that he was Alexander the Great, but the characteristics of Zul-Qarnain described in the Qur'an are not applicable to him". 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Quran's account reads as follows:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Surah 18:83-91</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                83 They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about Ⱬul-Qarnain. Say, "I will relate to you something of his narrative." <br>
                                84 Surely We established him in the land, and gave him the means to all things. <br>
                                85 So he travelled a course, <br>
                                86 Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a murky spring, and found a people in its vicinity. We said, "O Zul-Qarnain, you may either inflict a penalty, or else treat them kindly." <br>
                                87 He responded, "Whoever does wrong will be punished by us, then will be returned to their Lord, Who will punish them with a horrible torment. <br>
                                88 As for those who believe and do good, they will have the finest reward, and we will assign them easy commands." <br>
                                89 Then he travelled a ˹different˺ course <br>
                                90 until he reached the rising ˹point˺ of the sun. He found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shelter from it. <br>
                                91 So it was. And We truly had full knowledge of him. 
                            </p>

                            Notice that he found the place where the sun rises (verse 90) and sets, and that it sets in a spring of murky water (verse 86). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            While this passage teaches the absurdity that the sun sets in a pool of water, which is discussed in another <a href="../islam/muhammad-believed-that-the-sun-set-in-a-pool-of-water.html" target="_blank">article here</a>, this article will deal with the source of the legend recorded here in the Quran. This will bolster both the fact that Muhammad really was teaching that a man found a location where the sun actually sets, and also that the Quran contains myths and legends, passed off as divine revelation.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Note that Zul-Qarnain travels great distances, allegedly finding the location where the sun rises, and also where it sets. The features of this story find clear parallels in the main subject of this article, the <i>Alexander Romance</i>. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Alexander Romance</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Alexander Romance is a legendary biography of Alexander the Great, thought to have been composed in Greek in the early centuries AD. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            It was widely translated, and extremely popular in late antiquity. Andrew Smith at attalus.org has created <a href="https://www.attalus.org/info/alexander.html" target="_blank">a collation of the text</a> in the following three languages, which will be what is cited in this article:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Greek (3rd century)</li>
                            <li>Armenian (5th century)</li>
                            <li>Syriac (7th century)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Note that even though the evidence that this text was widely-disseminated by the time of Muhammad is massive and overwhelming, one does not actually need to be dogmatic on either language or dates, as long as they can demonstrate that the text was extant in the general vicinity of Muhammad chronologically. This is because legends can exist in oral form for centuries in many languages, before they are written down in any language.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Concerning content, the legend mentions the sun dozens of times, as one of the main focuses and plot points of the story. Therefore, it makes sense that the sun is what Muhammad's synopsis focused on in Surah 18. Reading the entire legend will bolster, not weaken, the case presented in this article, because what follows are just some highlights which are particularly striking in how closely they align with the account given in Surah 18 of the Quran:

                            When creating Islam, Muhammad incorporated a legendary biography of Alexander the Great into the Quran, and portrayed him as a Muslim. This gives weight to the accusations that were frequently lobbed at Muhammad by his contemporaries, and are recorded in the text of the Quran itself (Surah 6:25, 16:24, 23:83, 25:4-5, 27:68, 46:17, 68:15, 83:13):

                            Alexander the Great was not a Muslim, nor did he find where the sun sets, or rises. This single passage in Surah 18 indisputably refutes Islam in the mind of those concerned with the truth.

                                    This was their advice, though they had no idea of Alexander's position. They surrounded Alexander's advance posts by night, expecting him to hunt them all down while they were ignorant of the attack. But when the Belsyrians caught sight of Alexander's dispositions, they forgot all about fighting and their thoughts turned to flight: it was too much for them. At this point Seleucus brought his phalanx up against them; at once they turned tail, exemplifying the Homeric phrase: 'He came on like a lion and went off like a deer.' Seleucus' men charged and captured Eurymithres. Some of the enemy Alexander's men killed, other they pursued northwards for fifty days, until they came to two mountains in the unseen world, which they called the Breasts of the North.

                                    When they got there, Alexander stopped pursuing them. He saw that the two mountains would be suitable for closing up their exit, so he stayed there and prayed to God to help him close up the mountains to keep them out. He stood and prayed as follows:

                                    'God of gods, lord of all creation, who made all things by your Word, both heaven and earth. Nothing is impossible for you, all things are slaves to the word of your command. You spoke and they were created, you commanded and it was done. You alone are eternal, supreme, invisible, sole god, and there is no other but you. Through your name and your will I have done what you wished, and you have placed the whole world in my hands. I call now upon your name that is so often praised: fulfil this request of mine and cause these two mountains to come together, as I have asked of you, and do not look askance at me, wretched as I am, who have been so bold as to speak in this way. I know you care for me and your supreme goodness.'

                                    Immediately the mountains came together, though they had previously been 18 feet apart. When Alexander saw what had happened, he praised God. Then he built bronze gates, fixed them in the narrows between the two mountains and oiled them. The nature of the oil was such that it could not be burned by fire nor dislodged by iron. Within the gates, stretching back to the open country [for a distance of 3,000 miles] he planted brambles, which he watered well so that they formed a dense main over the mountains.

                                    So Alexander shut in twenty-two kings with their subject nations behind the northern boundaries - behind the gates that he called the Caspian and the mountains known as the Breasts. These are the names of those nations: Goth, Magoth, Anougeis, Aigeis, Exenach, Diphar, Photinaioi, Pharizaioi, Zarmatianoi, Chachonioi, Agrimardoi, Anouphagoi, Tharbaioi, Alans, Physolonikaioi, Saltarioi, and the rest. These were the nations that dwelt behind the gates that King Alexander built so as to be indestructible. They used to eat worms and foul things that were not real food at all - dogs, flies, snakes, aborted foetuses, dead bodies and unformed human embryos; and they ate not only animals but the corpses of humans as well. Alexander, seeing all this, was afraid that they would come out and pollute the inhabited world; so he shut them in and went on his way.
