                        <h3>1. Jesus Taught Believers to Pray "Our Father"</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            When giving a model of how believers are to pray, Jesus begins with the words "Our Father":
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Matthew 6:9</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                9 After this manner therefore pray ye: <b>Our Father</b> which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This is repeated in Luke 11:2. The fact that believers are children of God is a major theme in the New Testament (Matthew 7:11, John 1:12, Galatians 3:26, 4:4-6: 1 John 5:1, etc.), as is the fact that Jesus is the Son of God (John 3:16, Matthew 8:29, Mark 1:1, Luke 1:35, etc.). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In contrast, Muhammad entirely rejected the concept of God being a father to anyone:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Surah 37:151-52</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                151 Indeed, it is one of their ˹outrageous˺ fabrications to say, <br>
                                152 "Allah has children." They are simply liars.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Surah 5:18</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                18 <b>The Jews and the Christians each say, "We are the children of Allah and His most beloved!"</b> Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ "Why then does He punish you for your sins? No! You are only humans like others of His Own making. He forgives whoever He wills and punishes whoever He wills. To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. And to Him is the final return."
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This teaching is reiterated in Surah 2:116, 17:111, 19:35, 19:88-92, 21:26, 23:91, 39:4, 43:81, and 72:3. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Jesus, just as the Old Testament prophets (Genesis 6:1-4, Exodus 4:22, Deuteronomy 14:1, 32:5-6: 2 Samuel 7:14, Job 1:6, 2:1, 38:7, Psalm 2:7, 2:12, 73:15, 89:26, Isaiah 43:6, 63:16, 64:8, Jeremiah 3:19-20, Hosea 1:10, Malachi 2:10), taught a God that was a Father, with human beings as His children. He did so dozens of times, and taught us to open our prayers with that fact. Muhammad decried the entire concept of God as father. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>2. Muhammad Married a Divorced Woman</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In the Bible, Jesus teaches very clearly that if someone marries a person who is divorced for any other reason than fornication, they have committed adultery:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Matthew 5:31-32</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                31 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: <br>
                                32 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This is reiterated in Matthew 19:3-9, Mark 10:2-12, and Luke 16:18.
                        </p>
                        <!-- <p class="article-body">
                            This is in reference to the provision that God gave in the Law for divorce, which was an immediate annulling of the marriage because of fornication (Deuteronomy 22:13-21, 24:1-4), and it is reiterated in Matthew 19:3-9, Mark 10:2-12, and Luke 16:18. 
                        </p> -->
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In contrast, Muhammad not only taught that marrying a divorced person was permissible (Surah 2:230), he also personally married a divorced woman, whom his own stepson Zaid had divorced because of Muhammad, as covered in <a href="../islam/zaynab-bint-jahsh.html" target="_blank">this article</a>:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Surah 33:37</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                37 And ˹remember, O Prophet,˺ when you said to the one for whom Allah has done a favour and you ˹too˺ have done a favour, "Keep your wife and fear Allah," while concealing within yourself what Allah was going to reveal. And ˹so˺ you were considering the people, whereas Allah was more worthy of your consideration. <b>So when Zaid totally lost interest in ˹keeping˺ his wife, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there would be no blame on the believers for marrying the ex-wives of their adopted sons after their divorce. And Allah's command is totally binding.</b>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Moreover, in a bizarre verse, which actually contains the words of Umar (Sahih al-Bukhari 402), Muhammad threatens his wives with divorce, and then intimates that he might remarry women who have been divorced:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Surah 66:5</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                5 Perhaps, if he were to divorce you ˹all˺, his Lord would replace you with better wives who are submissive ˹to Allah˺, faithful ˹to Him˺, devout, repentant, dedicated to worship and fasting - previously married or virgins. 
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Whereas Jesus taught that remarriage after divorce is strictly forbidden, Muhammad taught the opposite, and additionally broke Jesus's commandment personally when he married Zaynab. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>3. Muhammad Taught that there is Marriage in Heaven</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Jesus taught that in Heaven, there will be no marriage:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Mark 12:23-25</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                23 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. <br>
                                24 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? <br>
                                25 <b>For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</b>

                        <p class="article-body">
                            This is found in the parallel accounts in Matthew 22:30, and Luke 20:35.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            In contrast, Muhammad taught that believers will be married to women in Heaven, and have intercourse with them for all eternity:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>

                        <p class="article-body">
                            This is reiterated in Surah 3:15, 4:57, 36:55-56, 37:48-49, 38:52, 43:70-71, 44:54, 52:20, 55:56, 55:70-74, 56:22-23, 56:35-37, and 78:33. These wives are also mentioned in Sahih al-Bukhari 2796, 3254, 3327, 4879-80, Sahih Muslim 2834a, 2834c, 2834e, Sunan Ibn Majah 4333, and Jami at-Tirmidhi 1663, 2522, 2536, 2735.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Muhammad's entire concept of Heaven is completely different from the one in Christianity, and even Judaism. The Bible describes the eternal state as dwelling with God in a totally remade earth (Isaiah 65:17-25: 1 Corinthians 15:20-28, Revelation 21:1-4), not Muhammad's heaven of intercourse, which is apparently inside of a 60 mile-wide pearl (Sahih al-Bukhari 3243, 4879-80, Sahih Muslim 2838a-c, Jami at-Tirmidhi 2528). In creating a heavenly paradise of his own desire, he again contradicted what Jesus Christ taught.

                            In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus forbade vain, repetitious prayer:

                            <h5 class="pt-2">Matthew 6:7-8</h5>

                                7 <b>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</b> <br>
                                8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            However, Muhammad taught his followers to do what is the <i>definition</i> of a vain repetition:

                            In some of these narrations, Muhammad recommended that one do this before bed, but in others, as highlighted above, he recommended it after <i>every prayer</i>. That would amount to 500 repetitions per day.

                            Of course, everyone who performs vain repetitions, when called out for doing so, will firmly deny that whatever they are doing is not vain repitition. This is immaterial. If chanting 3 prayers 33 times each, potentially multiple times per day, is not vain repitition, and if chanting a single phrase 100 times per day is not vain repitition, then nothing is. God does not hear a person because they say the same thing over and over again. That is what Jesus Christ taught, and Muhammad contradicted.

                            Returning again to the Sermon on the Mount, notice Jesus Christ's teaching on the topics of prayer, giving, and fasting:

                                1 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. <br>
                                2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. <br>
                                3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: <br>
                                4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. <br>
                                5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. <br>
                                6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. <br>
                                7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. <br>
                                8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. <br>
                                16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. <br>
                                17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; <br>
                                18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.

                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Jesus said that He has all power in Heaven and Earth (Matthew 28:18)</li>
                            <li>Jesus said that He is present whenever people gather in His name (Matthew 18:20)</li>
                            <li>Jesus said that He can be with millions of believers simultaneously (Matthew 28:20)</li>
                            <li>Jesus said that He can forgive sins (Matthew 9:2-6, Mark 2:5-12, Luke 5:20-26)</li>
                            <li>Jesus said that He can give people Eternal Life (John 10:28)</li>
                            <li>Jesus said that He can raise the dead, and will judge the living and the dead (John 5:21-22)</li>
                            <li>Jesus said that He has the keys of Hell and of death (Revelation 1:18)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Bible - which is the only record that anyone has for the life of Jesus - teaches an <i>entirely</i> different Jesus to the one Muhammad invented. According to the testimony that Jesus Christ gave about Himself, He is far more than a mere prophet; He is God's anointed Messiah. And, He is certainly not secondary to the sinner (Surah 40:55, 47:19, 48:1-2, Sahih al-Bukhari 6307) Muhammad.

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Islam affirms a "Jesus" that has never existed anywhere, and completely contradicts the only Jesus that history or Christians have ever known. But, any religion can affirm that "Jesus", because it is a fictional character invented in order to suit the needs of the one trying to hijack Jesus for their own purposes.
