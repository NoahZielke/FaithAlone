                            Muhammad is reported to have said that "soon", the Euphrates River will uncover a mountain of gold, causing a massive battle for it, in which many would die:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Sahih al-Bukhari 7119</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                Narrated Abu Huraira: <br>
                                Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Soon the river "Euphrates" will disclose the treasure (the mountain) of gold, so whoever will be present at that time should not take anything of it." Al-A'raj narrated from Abii Huraira that the Prophet (ﷺ) said the same but he said, "It (Euphrates) will uncover a mountain of gold (under it).
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Sahih Muslim 2894a</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: <br>
                                The Last Hour would not come before the Euphrates uncovers a mountain of gold, for which people would fight. Ninety-nine out of each one hundred would die, but every man amongst them would say that perhaps he would be the one who would be saved (and thus possess this gold).
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This is also narrated in Sahih Muslim 2894b-d, 2895, and Sunan Abi Dawud 4313-14.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Many of these narrations specifically say that this would happen "soon", and that it was a sign of the Last Hour. This is in keeping with Muhammad's frequent teaching that the Last Hour was near (Sahih al-Bukhari 5301, etc.). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            However, there was no mountain of gold revealed by the Euphrates River, nor a massive battle over the gold, in which a massive desolation like the one described by Muhammad - 99 out of every 100 people - would die fighting over it. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Some Muslims have related this to oil being discovered in the Middle East, glossing over the fact that oil would not become a large part of the world's economy until well over 1,000 years after the time of Muhammad. In reinterpreting this prophecy, such Muslims ignore the provision that the uncovering would take place "soon", and they also turn the desolation described by Muhammad into hyperbole. 
                        </p>
