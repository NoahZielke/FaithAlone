                            The predominant view in Islam is that musical instruments are <i>Haram</i> (forbidden). The website Al-Islam.org presents what is the standard conservative Muslim view:
                        </p>

                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Status of Music in Islam - Shaykh Saleem Bhimji</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                Playing instruments of music is a great Sin. It is haram to play instruments such as the guitar, piano, tambourine, drums etc. Listening to music is also a great sin. <br> <br>

                                All the Mujtahids are unanimous in their opinion that the manufacturing, selling and purchasing of musical instruments is haram and any income derived from musical activity is also haram. The transactions involving these instruments are invalid (bātil). It is haram to keep instruments of music in one's possession - it is obligatory to destroy them.
                            </p>

Such articles cite scores of Muslim sources, establishing that music, and musical instruments, are forbidden, and sinful, outside of scant, hyper-specific exceptions, and are certainly not part of the normative worship of God.

Allah will destroy them during the night and will let the mountain fall on them, and He will transform the rest of them into monkeys and pigs and they will remain so till the Day of Resurrection."

                            Above, "musical instruments" are included alongside other forbidden things, in a list of what some of Muhammad's hypocritical followers will allow. Therefore, they are assumed to be forbidden in the same manner as the rest of the things in the list are forbidden.

                        <h3>Muhammad's "Affirmation" of the Bible</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Muhammad, in the Quran, constantly claimed that he was affirming the Bible (Surah 3:3-4, 5:43-48, 5:68, etc.). Notice how he explicitly names the Psalms as having been sent from God:
                        </p>
                        <!-- Surah 34:10 -->

                                163 Indeed, We have sent revelation to you ˹O Prophet˺ as We sent revelation to Noah and the prophets after him. We also sent revelation to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants, ˹as well as˺ Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon. <b>And to David We gave the Psalms.</b>
                            </p>

                            What is so ridiculous about the above, in light of the Muslim view of music, is that the book of Psalms is a <i>song</i> book, containing 150 <i>songs</i>. The word "Psalm" means "song". And, more than 50 of the Psalms are addressed "to the chief <i>musician</i>". The author of many of the Psalms, David, was known for playing the harp (1 Samuel 16:23: 2 Samuel 6:5: 1 Chronicles 13:8). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Psalms frequently and explicitly extol the use of musical instruments in worship of the Lord (Psalm 57:7-9, 68:24-25, 71:22, 81:1-4, 87:7, 92:1-4, 108:1-3, 144:9):

                            Notice above that in addition to the use of many different kinds of instruments, <i>dancing</i> - another thing deemed Haram by most Muslims - is also extolled, in a book predating Muhammad by about 2,000 years, which he claimed to affirm, and professed was sent by God. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The use of instruments in worship of God is encouraged many times in the Old Testament outside of the book of Psalms (Exodus 15:20-21: 1 Samuel 10:5-6: 1 Chronicles 15:16-29, 16:41-42, 23:5: 2 Chronicles 5:12-14, 7:6, 29:25-26, 30:21, Isaiah 38:20, Jeremiah 31:4, Nehemiah 12:27, 12:36, Habakkuk 3:17-19). In the New Testament, believers are exhorted to sing Psalms (Ephesians 5:19, Colossians 3:16), which, as noted already, exalt the worship of God using musical instruments. And, in the book of Revelation, those in Heaven worship the Lord with musical instruments (Revelation 5:8-9, 15:2-3).
                            <!--(Matthew 26:30, Mark 14:26, Ephesians 5:19, Colossians 3:16)--> 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This is consistent with the claim that the same God gave us both the Old Testament and the New Testament. It is utterly <i>inconsistent</i> with the claim that this same God also gave us the Quran.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This seemingly small issue is a microcosm of Islam - a religion that claims to affirm a divine song book which extols the use of musical instruments, then prohibits music, and musical instruments. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This clean break from the consistent message of the Bible is demonstrative of the fact that Muhammad was not in the Biblical line of prophets, as he claimed, but instead, attempted to create his own religion, while paying lip-service to a tradition that he had no part in, leading to bizarre inconsistencies like the one covered in this article.
