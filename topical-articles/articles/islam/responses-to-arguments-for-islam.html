                        <p class="article-body">
                            The argument that the Quran is a literary miracle which cannot be truly reproduced comes from the Quran itself (Surah 10:38, 11:13-14, 17:88, and 52:34):
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Surah 2:23-24</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                23 And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a s√ªrah like it and call your helpers other than Allah, if what you say is true. <br>
                                24 But if you are unable to do so - and you will never be able to do so - then fear the Fire fuelled with people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers. 
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <!-- Satanic verses -->
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Quran is, in reality, very easy to reproduce, and has been in works like <i>The True Furqan</i>. However, since the challenge must be judged by Muslims, is regarded as blasphemous to even attempt, and has a foregone conclusion - "you will never be able to do so" - it is not a serious or genuine challenge. Even if the Quran <i>were</i> impossible to reproduce, that would do nothing to prove it is from God, but rather it would prove that it is unique. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Muslims, also, will often claim that the Quran is regarded by Muslims and non-Muslims alike as the greatest work of literature in Arabic, or even in any language:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2"><a href="https://icna.org/the-miracles-of-the-qurans-literature-unveiling-divine-eloquence/" target="_blank">The Qur'an: A Literary Masterpiece That Transcends Generations</a></h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                The Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, is widely regarded as a literary masterpiece. Its profound impact on Arabic literature, its eloquence, and the timeless message it conveys have captivated both scholars and believers for centuries.  <br> <br>
                            
                                The Qur'an was revealed in the Arabic language, and it showcases unparalleled linguistic excellence. The book's language is pristine, with a flawless blend of eloquence, rhythm, and precision. Despite being revealed more than 1400 years ago, the Qur'an's linguistic beauty remains unmatched. Its expressive metaphors, captivating narratives, and compelling arguments demonstrate the ingenuity of its composition, leaving a lasting impact on those who delve into its verses.

                            Contrary to the above, some of the literary issues with the Quran are as follows, and can be verified by anyone who simply sits down to read Surah 1-5:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>It has no narrative at all. Rather, it is a scatterbrained collection of Muhammad's teachings on worldly affairs, defenses of himself, lambasts of his enemies, vague exaltations of God, and poorly-retold Bible stories and legends</li>
                            <li>The stories that it does tell are always incomplete. Characters are referenced without any introduction or context as to who they are. The setting is often totally missing, and the story will start or end abruptly. Characters do not seem real, rather taking the form of disembodied voices attached to names, saying what Muhammad usually says, <a href="../islam/muhammadese.html" target="_blank">sounding exactly like him,</a> even maintaining his Arabic rhymes </li>
                            <li>It frequently and jarringly jumps around topics within a single chapter. Teachings on a single topic, or details of the same story - creation, for instance - are often dispersed between many chapters in a piecemeal way</li>
                            <li>To maintain his Arabic rhyming, he ends hundreds and hundreds of verses with statements such as "And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful", even when it has nothing to do with what was just said</li>
                            <li>It is supremely, endlessly repetitive</li>
                            <li>The organization of the chapters - roughly longest to shortest - is illogical. And, because of the doctrine of abrogation (Surah 2:106, 16:101), one must go <i>outside the Quran</i> for a list of the chapters in chronological order (which will be contested) in order to know which teaching is canonical</li>
                            <li>It contains many "revelations" that only mattered to Muhammad and his life (Surah 33:50, 33:53, 49:1-5, etc.), including many dozens of passages in which he defends his character, or sanity, or truthfulness</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The fact that anyone can make the argument that the Quran is a literary masterpiece shows the depth of self-deception that someone can be goaded into by their beliefs.

                        <h3>The Quran has No Contradictions</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The argument that the Quran is divine because it contains no contradictions also comes from the Quran itself:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Surah 4:82</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                82 Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Had it been from anyone other than Allah, they would have certainly found in it many inconsistencies. 
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            To begin, the lack of contradictions in a book does not make that book divine. There are math books, fictional books, tutorial books, historical books, and books in other genres, which do not contain self-contradictory information. That does not mean they are from God. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Secondly, the Quran does have contradictions, even according to Muslims. The aforementioned doctrine of abrogation (Surah 2:106, 16:101) is a method to resolve contradictory revelations that Muhammad delivered, teaching to always favor whatever is latest, if there is contradiction. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            One example of this would be the punishment for adultery. First, the Quran's prescribed punishment for an adulterous woman involves her being placed under house arrest for the rest of her life (Surah 4:15). Then, the punishment of stoning was prescribed, which is now lost (Sahih al-Bukhari 6830). Then, the punishment of being flogged 100 times was given, and this is what is authoritative today (Surah 24:2). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The doctrine of abrogation is a demonstration of how ad-hoc Muhammad's revelations were. If the Quran was Allah's eternal word, written on a tablet in Heaven (Surah 85:21-22), would it need to have sections abrogated over the span of just a few decades, as Muhammad's circumstances changed?

                        <p class="article-body">
                            One of the most common Muslim claims about the Quran is that it is perfectly preserved, and exists in one form only, and this constitutes proof that it is divine in origin:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>

                            <p class="mb-1">
                                The Glorious Quran is the pure word of God. There is not a single word therein that is not divine. The Book has been handed down to our age in its complete and original form since the time of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. <br> <br>
                                The Book that God revealed to him for the guidance of mankind exists today in its original language without the slightest alteration in its vocabulary.

                                The Quran is the holy book of Islam. It is a collection of revelations that were received by the Prophet Muhammad over the course of twenty-three years in the 7th century CE. There is only one version of the Quran, perfectly preserved in written and oral records around the world for nearly 1400 years. 
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The above statements are inaccurate. The Quran has not been perfectly preserved, even according to Islam's own sources - the subject of <a href="../islam/refuting-the-perfect-preservation-of-the-quran.html" target="_blank">this article</a>. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Likewise, there is not "only one version" of the Quran. The text of the Quran used by most Muslims today was not standardized until 1924 in Cairo, Egypt. There are more than 30 Arabic versions of the Quran, containing thousands of textual variants between them, as collated by Hatun Tash and the team at DCCI Ministries. There are also textual variants within the manuscript traditions for each of these Arabic versions. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In addition, even if the Quran were to be perfectly preserved, that would not be proof of its divine origin. It would be proof of a dedicated following, or good textual transmission practices. With the advent of computing, there will be millions of books written every year, which will be perfectly preserved.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            So, the Quran is not perfectly preserved, however, if it were, that would still not prove that Islam is the true religion.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Many Muslims claim that the Quran contains advanced knowledge of scientific discoveries that would have been impossible to know in the 7th century:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>

                                The Quran contains scientific knowledge that could not have been known 1400 years ago. It ranges from basic arithmetics to the most advanced topics in astrophysics. You are invited to go through those miracles and judge for yourself.

                            While this short section cannot hope to address all of the verses claimed to teach some scientific fact, if one does bother to investigate such claims, they will find that one of two things are true: 
                        </p>
                        <ol style="font-size:large">
                            <li>The "scientific miracle" was based on observations which were <i>very</i> possible in the 7th century, or any century, by any mildly-intelligent person</li>
                            <li>The "scientific miracle" was based on reading modern science into extremely vague verses, which of themselves make no scientific claim, and have not been historically interpreted as making any such claim, in any of the early Tafsir</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            However, not only does the Quran contain no scientific miracles whatsoever, it <i>does</i> contain scientific errors, and so do the Hadith. What follows are five examples, along with articles covering them in more detail:

                        <h3>Islam is the Fastest Growing Religion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Anyone who engages with Muslims on the popular level will find that one of the most common proofs that they submit for the truthfulness of Islam - no doubt something they personally find very compelling - are variations of the following:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Islam is the fastest growing religion - while Christianity is declining</li>
                            <li>If Muhammad wasn't a real prophet, why does he have 2 billion people following him?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Firstly, neither of these claims can be granted - at least not without asterisks. There are not anywhere near 2 billion Muslims, and Islam spreads via birthrates, not conversions by educated, rational adults. This is almost ubiquitously stated in all of the studies that Muslims will link to in order to validate their claim.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            For example:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2"><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2017/04/06/why-muslims-are-the-worlds-fastest-growing-religious-group/" target="_blank">Why Muslims are the World's Fastest-Growing Religious Group</a></h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                <b>The main reasons for Islam's growth ultimately involve simple demographics. To begin with, Muslims have more children than members of the seven other major religious groups analyzed in the study.</b> Muslim women have an average of 2.9 children, significantly above the next-highest group (Christians at 2.6) and the average of all non-Muslims (2.2). In all major regions where there is a sizable Muslim population, Muslim fertility exceeds non-Muslim fertility. 
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Actual converts of conviction to Islam are rare, and often paraded around, precisely for that reason.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Further, there are not 2 billion Muslims. That figure includes government-reported census data in Sharia nations, often boasting a 95-99% Muslim population, which is comical. These figures are not representative, because many become silent apostates, due to the penalty for leaving the false religion of Islam being death (Sahih al-Bukhari 3017, etc.), not to mention the huge range of other temporal penalties that public apostasy opens one up to in most of these nations.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This is evidenced by polls such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211204134612/https://theconversation.com/irans-secular-shift-new-survey-reveals-huge-changes-in-religious-beliefs-145253" target="_blank">this one</a> from a non-government organization in Iran - a nation which officially reports to be 99% Muslim - wherein less than <i>half</i> of the respondents professed to believe in Islam. There is no reason to believe that the case is not similar in other Sharia nations. Adding to this all of the cultural or nominal Muslims, and Islam becomes a much smaller religion.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            However, even if both of these claims are granted, they are meaningless as far as determining the true religion is concerned. Christianity is still the world's largest religion. Does that prove anything? No, it does not. At one point, Communism was growing so fast, that it went from not formally existing, to dominating some of the largest nations on earth, in less than 150 years. Does that prove anything? Further, there are over 1 billion Hindus, and over 1 billion people who profess no formal adherence to any religion. Does that make those positions correct? Of course not. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            If one is a Muslim, they are asserting that all 2 billion Christians, 1 billion Hindus, and 1 billion religiously-unaffiliated people are wrong, and basing their lives on lies and falsehood. Therefore, a Muslim must concede that it is possible for a huge amount of people to be deceived. And, that is precisely what has happened with Islam.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The frequency at which this claim is used is actually evidence that Islam truly has no compelling evidence to offer. Therefore, its adherents latch on to meaningless arguments like this.

                            Muslims, eager to prove the above verse true, have submitted various Bible verses over the centuries which are allegedly a fulfillment of this passage. This has resulted in some of the most egregious, dishonest twisting of Scripture ever performed by anyone.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Firstly, note that Muhammad himself did not give the reference to what supposedly mentioned him. In the New Testament, Old Testament verses that Jesus Christ fulfilled are often quoted in the text of the New Testament, as the event is being narrated. Muhammad did not do this, because he could not do this - he had only an oral familiarity with a few Bible stories, being otherwise totally ignorant of its contents.

                            Muhammad was not the prophet like unto Moses for the following reasons:

                            <li>The preceding context demonstrates that the "among their brethren" here refers to Jews (Deuteronomy 17:14-15, 17:18-20, 18:1-2, 18:15-16). Muhammad was not a Jew, and didn't even claim to be a Jew</li>
                            <li>At the end of the book, the "prophet like Moses" is specifically described as one who would be "in Israel", "whom the Lord knew face to face", and was mighty in "signs and wonders" (Deuteronomy 34:10-12). None of these things describe Muhammad </li>
                            <li>This verse is explicitly said to be fulfilled in Jesus Christ in the New Testament (Acts 3:22-26, 7:37, 7:52), and He met all the criteria for fulfillment over 500 years before Muhammad</li>
                            <li>The very next verse, Deuteronomy 18:20, prescribes the death penalty for speaking a word of prophecy which God did not command him to speak. Muhammad was guilty of this, according to himself, during the <a href="../islam/satanic-verses.html" target="_blank">Satanic Verses Incident</a>. Therefore, on the basis of that testimony, he was not a prophet sent by God</li>

                            <li>The Comforter is said to be "with" the disciples, and "dwelling with them" (John 14:17), soon to be "in them" (John 14:17). None of this describes Muhammad</li>
                            <li>The Comforter is identified in the context as the Holy Ghost - "But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name" (John 14:26)</li>

                            Firstly, this proof, as well as the following section on miracles, are non-starters. They are Biblically irrelevant, in light of Deuteronomy 13:1-5, in which God says that <i>even if</i> someone performs a miracle, or gives a prophecy, they are still a false prophet, if they preach another God. Muhammad certainly preached another God - a God called "Allah" who is a father to no one, not Yahweh (Exodus 3:15), who is the Father (Deuteronomy 14:1, John 1:12, etc.). Jesus gave the same principle (Matthew 24:24, Mark 13:22), as did the Apostles (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12).

                            Thirdly, many of Muhammad's prophecies failed, such as his prophecy that the world would end within 100 years (Sahih al-Bukhari 116, 564, Sahih Muslim 2538a, 2539), or within the life of a young slave in his presence (Sahih al-Bukhari 6167), or within the lifespan of an Ansari child (Sahih Muslim 2952, 2953a-c).

He even was open to a young man named Ibn Sayyad being the Dajjal, which is an End Times figure in Islam (Sahih al-Bukhari 3055, Sahih Muslim 169d, 2924a-b, 2925, 2930a-c, 2931), even spying on him (Sahih al-Bukhari 3056-57, Sahih Muslim 169d, 2930a-c, 2931), and causing much trouble for him (Sahih Muslim 2927a-c, 2929).

He also said that there would remain a group of faithful Muslims until the Last Hour (Sahih al-Bukhari 7312, 7459, Sahih Muslim 1925), but at other times, he said that the Last Hour would not come until the Hajj was abandoned (Sahih al-Bukhari 1593), and none said "Allah, Allah" in the earth (Sahih Muslim 148a-b, Jami at-Tirmidhi 2207).

                            Fourthly, in the same vein as the "scientific miracles" in the Quran and Hadith, the prophecies that are commonly purported to have been given by Muhammad and fulfilled are unremarkable. They are either vague, obvious, or truisms, which anyone could have predicted, or they were not far enough removed in time from what they were predicting to preclude fabrication, or they are specific predictions which have not been fulfilled at all, and require one to reinterpret them into saying something that they do not even say, in order to pretend that they have been fulfilled. Every single one without exception is invalidated under one of these basic criticisms.

                            Also, virtually all of the alleged fulfilled prophecies are from the Hadith, and <i>not</i> the Quran. In the Quran, Muhammad repeatedly claimed to have no knowledge of the unseen (Surah 6:50, 7:188, 10:20, 11:31, 27:65), and therefore, the Quran is bereft of future prophecy. The quintessential example of fulfilled prophecy in the Quran, Surah 30:2-5, is a vague predication that one empire will win a battle in the coming years against another. There are many prophecies of this type in the Bible, which Muslims disregard (Isaiah 45:1-3: 2 Samuel 5:19: 2 Chronicles 20:15, etc.). And, there is a narration stating that this passage of the Quran was revealed after the event took place, meaning it would not be a prophecy at all (Jami at-Tirmidhi 3192). There are also textual difficulties with this passage, and historical controversy over whether it was actually completed within the alleged allotted time frame. Yet, apart from this alleged prophecy, the Quran is basically bereft of any attempts at prophecy, especially when compared to the Biblical prophets.

                            The Hadith, on the other hand, were compiled hundreds of years after Muhammad died - long after anyone could scrutinize him - and in the case of some of the prophecies in question, hundreds of years after they were allegedly fulfilled. The next section will touch on why that is such a problem.

                            One is left to wonder why people in the Quran were asking Muhammad for signs, when according to the above, he was prolifically performing signs. The most straightforward answer is that these miracle accounts are pious fabrications, gathered two centuries after Muhammad died. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Commenting on this development, Henry Heydt, in his book "A Comparison of World Religions", referring to the Persian historian Mirkhvand, says: 
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">A Comparison of World Religions, pg. 32</h5>

                                Although (Muhammad) himself disclaimed working miracles, Mirkhond wrote in the fifteenth century a life of Muhammad including some fifty pages of miracles he was supposed to have performed.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            To get to his 50 pages of miracles, Mirkhvand, of course, was using Hadith, and maybe some earlier biographies. If one expands their sources outside of the six canonical Hadith collections, 50 pages would not suffice at all. They would need hundreds of pages. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            So, why is all of that so absent from the Quran? And, why does Muhammad deny the ability to perform signs so often in the Quran, when asked to? Why doesn't he say, "Watch me walk past this tree, and listen to it greet me"? Or, "I just did 5 miracles last week, what are you talking about"? Rather, he describes himself repeatedly as a "plain warner".
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            So, one can conclude that Muhammad did not perform any miracles, because that was his sheepish testimony in the Quran, when he was faced with people during his life, who could actually watch him. In the later narrations one can see fantastic embellishments, invented long after Muhammad was dead, and not subject to scrutiny by people who could actually observe him.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This tendency toward embellishment is evident if one examines the account of the compilation of the Hadith narrations themselves, in which Bukhari was said to have sorted through 600,000 narrations for his Sahih, discounting 99% of them. This demonstrates the penchant for legendary accounts in the Muslim community, and their willingness to believe and repeat legends for which they had no veracity. The later traditions chronicling Muhammad's miracles show that the Hadith fundamentally cannot be trusted, and include lots of legendary tales that had begun to develop of the miraculous exploits of Allah's self-professed "plain warner". 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Finally, as mentioned in the section above, this argument is, Biblically speaking, dead on arrival, because miracles do not of themselves vindicate someone as a true prophet, if what they preached was contrary to the preaching of the prophets before them (Deuteronomy 13:1-5, Matthew 24:24, Mark 13:22: 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12). Yet, if one were to use miracles as a criteria for truthfulness, the Bible records many miracles being done by Christians (Acts 2:43, 3:1-10, 5:12-16, 9:36-42, 14:8-10, 20:9-12, Romans 15:18-19: 2 Corinthians 12:12, etc.) - not to mention the miracles of Jesus Christ Himself - and unlike the Hadith, these accounts were written in the lifetimes of the eyewitnesses of the events.

Every single religious official of any religion would claim sincerity, and they believe that what they are doing is correct, and godly. They may even do many kind and humanitarian things for others. All of this says nothing about whether their religion is correct.

                            Of course, from a Christian perspective, the worst thing Muhammad did was tell constant, egregious lies about God and Jesus Christ, and deceive people with a false religion, which has perpetuated misery and suffering for 1,400 years.

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            When examined, all of the proposed reasons to join Islam fall apart. There is no proof for the veracity of Islam, which is why the above reasons, all of which are invalid, need to be appealed to.
