                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In the Quran, Muhammad claimed to be affirming the teaching of the Torah and the Gospel which came before him, which he proclaimed to be guidance given to mankind by God, on which they were to stand.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            For instance:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Surah 3:3</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                3 He has revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ the Book in truth, <b>confirming what came before it, as He revealed the Torah and the Gospel</b>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Surah 5:43-47</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                43 <b>But why do they come to you for judgment when they ˹already˺ have the Torah containing Allah's judgment,</b> then they turn away after all? They are not ˹true˺ believers. <br>
                                44 Indeed, We revealed the Torah, containing guidance and light, by which the prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah, made judgments for Jews. So too did the rabbis and scholars judge according to Allah's Book, with which they were entrusted and of which they were made keepers. So do not fear the people; fear Me! Nor trade my revelations for a fleeting gain. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the disbelievers. <br>
                                45 We ordained for them in the Torah, "A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth - and for wounds equal retaliation." But whoever waives it charitably, it will be atonement for them. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the wrongdoers. <br>
                                46 Then in the footsteps of the prophets, We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah revealed before him. And We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light and confirming what was revealed in the Torah - a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing. <br>
                                47 <b>So let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed in it.</b> And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the rebellious.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Surah 5:68</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                68 Say: "O People of the Book! <b>ye have no ground to stand upon unless ye stand fast by the Law, the Gospel, and all the revelation that has come to you from your Lord."</b> It is the revelation that cometh to thee from thy Lord that increaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. But sorrow thou not over (these) people without Faith.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            However, what Muhammad preached did not confirm either the Torah or the Gospel, but rather contradicted them on dozens of major points of doctrine. Muslims unanimously dismiss this, asserting that this is evidence of the Bible's corruption. However, Muhammad never stated that the Bible was corrupted. Instead, in passages like the ones above, he appealed to it for authority, in an attempt to establish himself as a continuation of the Biblical prophets. If God had truly wanted to communicate to the Jews and Christians that the Bible had been irretrievably corrupted on nearly every page, that would have been made abundantly clear in any subsequent message He gave. Instead of such a warning in the Quran, we see the opposite. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Moreover, it is illogical to claim that God inspired Scripture to give to mankind as a guide, and then allowed it to be corrupted, all the while commanding them to judge by it. The New Testament, in particular, had an extremely free transmission, and was never within the power of any single group or geographic area that would have allowed wholesale alteration. When God inspires a text, He preserves it - such is His promise (Isaiah 40:8, Matthew 5:18, 24:35, Mark 13:31). Likewise, in Islam, as seen above, the Quran says that the Torah and Gospel were sent from God, and Muhammad stated that God wrote the Torah "with His own hand" (Sahih al-Bukhari 6614, Sahih Muslim 2652a). Then, the Quran states multiple times that "none can alter His words" (Surah 6:115, 18:27). Therefore, both Christianity and Islam reject the idea that God's Words can be lost, or corrupted. God is not going to inspire a text, and command people to judge by that text, if that text is not reliable, preserved, and true; or if that text, taken in context, with integrity, would actually misguide them.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            And, it is useless to claim that Muhammad affirmed a "Torah" or "Gospel" that is now lost, as he spoke of them throughout the Quran as books that could be referenced, during his time in the 7th century (see above, also Surah 3:93, 7:157). There are even narrations in which Muhammad appealed to a copy of the Torah that some Jews had in order to determine the punishment for adultery (Sahih al-Bukhari 3635, Sahih Muslim 1699a-c, etc.), meaning that he recognized the Scripture they had at that time as legitimate. According to another narration, he stated that the Torah and Gospel were with the Jews and the Christians at that time (Jami at-Tirmidhi 2653). Another narration has Muhammad placing a copy of the Torah on a judgment cushion, and saying "I believe in thee and in Him Who revealed thee" (Sunan Abi Dawud 4449). <!--And, these statements are never qualified with warnings that the text of these Scriptures has become lost, or utterly corrupted, in the manner which Islam would need it to be to vindicate Muhammad's prophethood.-->
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Therefore, if it is the case that they had the Torah and Gospel during the time of Muhammad, then people today likewise have the Torah and the Gospel, as there are existing copies of the entire Bible from hundreds of years before Muhammad, and thousands of pages of writings from Christians living in many different locations, writing in many different languages, who likewise long predated Muhammad, and quote thousands of verses of Scripture. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Finally, one has to consider the meaninglessness of claiming to affirm a lost book which no one can reference to verify whether they actually affirm it. Anyone, at any point in history, could claim to affirm a well-known corpus of religious texts, and then later claim that those texts were all lost or corrupted when they are found to have contradicted them. The older must stand in judgment of the newer, which is why Christians affirm every last word of the Old Testament, and never had to claim that it was all "lost" or "corrupted". 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            So, what follows are examples demonstrating Muhammad's many irreconcilable contradictions with the religious texts that he claimed to affirm, which stand in judgement of him, and confirm him to have been a false prophet, who was claiming to affirm a tradition which he was largely ignorant of, and had no place in.

                            <li>Muhammad taught that the Israelites, when given the Old Covenant by God, said "We hear and disobey" (Surah 2:93, directly contradicting Exodus 19:9, 24:3, 24:7, Joshua 24:21-24)</li>
                            <li>Muhammad taught that Moses wanted God to separate him and Aaron from the Israelites (Surah 5:25-26), when the Bible says that Moses would have rather died than be separated from the Israelites, and entreated God on their behalf (Exodus 32:31-32, Numbers 14:11-20)</li>
                            <li>Muhammad taught that the penalty for thievery is cutting off the hands rather than repayment (Surah 5:38, contradicting Exodus 22:1-12)</li>

                            <li>Muhammad taught that a divorced woman is required to marry someone else, and then also divorce them, before she can return to the original husband (Surah 2:230, directly contradicting Deuteronomy 24:1-4, Jeremiah 3:1) </li>

                            <li>Muhammad taught that one can marry a woman temporarily, with the full intention of divorcing her (Sahih al-Bukhari 4615, 5075, 5117-18, Sahih Muslim 1404a-c, 1405a-b, Sunan Ibn Majah 1962, contradicting Leviticus 19:29, Deuteronomy 23:17, Matthew 5:32, Ephesians 5:5, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Muhammad taught that God has no son, therefore Jesus is not the Son of God (Surah 2:116, 5:18, 17:111, 19:35, 19:88-92, 21:26, 23:91, 37:151-52, 39:4, 43:81, 72:3, despite affirming the virgin birth of Jesus in Surah 3:47, 19:20-21, 21:91, 66:12, contradicting John 10:36, Matthew 16:16-17, Mark 14:61-62, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Muhammad taught that Jesus was born under a palm tree in the wilderness, instead of in a crowded Bethlehem (Surah 19:22-27, contradicting Matthew 2:1-14, Luke 2:1-7, Micah 5:2)</li>
                            <li>Muhammad taught that Jesus denied knowing the Father (Surah 5:116, contradicting Matthew 11:27, Luke 10:22)</li>
                            <li>Muhammad taught that believers are not God's children (contradicting Isaiah 63:16, 64:8, John 1:12, Galatians 3:26), because if they were God's children, He would not punish them for their sins (Surah 5:18, directly contradicting Hebrews 12:6-8, Proverbs 3:11-12, 13:24, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Muhammad taught that believers are able to have spouses and intercourse in Heaven (Surah 2:25, 3:15, 4:57, 36:55-56, 37:48-49, 38:52, 43:70-71, 44:54, 52:20, 55:56, 55:70-74, 56:22-23, 56:35-37, 78:33, contradicting Matthew 22:30, Mark 12:25, Luke 20:35)</li>
                            <li>Muhammad denied that Jesus died on the cross as a substitutionary, atoning sacrifice for the sins of mankind (Surah 4:157-158, contradicting Matthew 20:28, 27:50, Mark 10:45, 15:37, Luke 23:46, John 19:30, Revelation 1:18, Isaiah 53:7-12, Daniel 9:26, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Muhammad taught that believers will spend eternity in Heaven (Surah 2:25, 3:15, etc.) rather than with God in the New Earth (Revelation 21:1-4: 1 Corinthians 15:20-28, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Muhammad taught that believers are required to pay an alms-tax (Surah 2:43, 2:83, 5:12, 9:18, 24:56 and dozens of others, contradicting 2 Corinthians 9:7) </li>
                            <li>Muhammad taught that believers are forbidden from eating pork (Surah 2:173, 5:3, 6:145, 16:115, directly contradicting 1 Timothy 4:3-5, Acts 10:12-15, Galatians 3:13, 3:23-25: 1 Corinthians 10:25-27, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Muhammad taught that God does not want everyone to believe and be saved (Surah 10:99-100, directly contradicting 1 Timothy 2:3-4: 2 Peter 3:9)</li>
                            <li>Muhammad taught that believers must divorce unbelievers (Surah 60:10, contradicting 1 Corinthians 7:13-14)</li>
                            <li>Muhammad taught that one cannot pray when the sun is directly overhead, or at sunrise and sunset (Sahih al-Bukhari 581-588, Sahih Muslim 825-829, Sunan an-Nasai 572, Sunan Ibn Majah 1253, Sunan Abi Dawud 1277, contradicting 1 Thessalonians 5:17, Psalm 55:17)</li>
                            <li>Muhammad taught that if someone leaves the faith, they must be executed (Sahih al-Bukhari 3017, 6922, Sahih Muslim 1676a-d, contradicting John 6:66-67: 2 Thessalonians 3:14-15: 1 Timothy 1:19-20)</li>
                            <li>Muhammad taught that good deeds determine whether one goes to Heaven - one must believe <i>and</i> do good works, in order to get into Heaven (Surah 2:25, 2:62, 2:277, 13:39, 17:9, 18:2, 19:60, 19:96, 22:23, 34:4, 47:12, 48:29, 65:11, 103:3, and dozens of others, contradicting Romans 4:5, Ephesians 2:8-9, Titus 3:5, Romans 11:6, etc.) </li>
