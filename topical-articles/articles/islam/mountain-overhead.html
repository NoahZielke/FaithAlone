                        <p class="article-body">
                            In the Quran, Muhammad repeatedly recounts the story of the Israelites accepting the Covenant with God at Mount Sinai, during the Exodus.

                            In these accounts, it is stated that God "raised the mountain above them", and that God "raised the mountain over them, as if it were a cloud, and they thought it would fall on them":

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Notice that in the last verse above, the Israelites are recorded saying, "We hear, and disobey". This is illogical, and unrealistic. The God of the universe, in this account, is suspending a mountain over their heads, and threatening to drop it, if they do not agree to the Covenant. In such a circumstance, the vast majority of people, if even out of fear alone, would quickly say that they will obey, while trembling. If anyone were to dare to say, "We disobey", those around them, out of fear, would quickly shut them up, strike them, or even kill them. That is what would happen in reality. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Therefore, the Quran's account of the Israelites saying "We hear, and disobey", in response to God's directive to "Hold firmly to that ˹Scripture˺ which We have given you and obey", is unrealistic. And, the above account differs dramatically from the Bible's account of the same event. 
                        </p>

                            In the Bible, the Covenant is proposed to the people in Exodus 19, and then it is ratified in Exodus 24. Notice the people's response each time:

                            The response of the people is exactly the opposite of what it was portrayed as in the Quran. The people agree to the Covenant, and tell God that they will obey it. Whether they kept it later or not is immaterial. What they <i>said</i> was that they would keep it, whereas the Quran has them telling God that they will not keep it.

                            And, there is nothing whatsoever in the Biblical account of God raising the mountain over their heads, or threatening to drop a mountain on them. In order to understand where Muhammad got this tradition, one must go outside the Bible, to the Babylonian Talmud.

                                5 The Gemara cites additional homiletic interpretations on the topic of the revelation at Sinai. The Torah says, "And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lowermost part of the mount" (Exodus 19:17). Rabbi Avdimi bar Ḥama bar Ḥasa said: the Jewish people actually stood beneath the mountain, and the verse teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, overturned the mountain above the Jews like a tub, and said to them: If you accept the Torah, excellent, and if not, there will be your burial.
                                
                                <!-- Rav Aḥa bar Ya'akov said: From here there is a substantial caveat to the obligation to fulfill the Torah. The Jewish people can claim that they were coerced into accepting the Torah, and it is therefore not binding. Rava said: Even so, they again accepted it willingly in the time of Ahasuerus, as it is written: "The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them" (Esther 9:27), and he taught: The Jews ordained what they had already taken upon themselves through coercion at Sinai. -->

                                15 Rather, this is what they say: Did we accept the Torah and then not fulfill its mitzvot? The Gemara asks: But this itself serves as the refutation of their own claim, as one can respond: Why didn't you accept it? Rather, this is what the nations of the world say before Him: Master of the Universe, did You overturn the mountain above us like a basin, and we still did not accept the Torah, as You did for the Jewish people? <br> <br>

                                16 The Gemara provides the background for this claim: As it is written: "And they stood at the nether part of the mount" (Exodus 19:17), and Rav Dimi bar Ḥama says: The verse teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, overturned the mountain, i.e., Mount Sinai, above the Jews like a basin, and He said to them: If you accept the Torah, excellent, and if not, there, under the mountain, will be your burial. The nations of the world will claim that they too could have been coerced to accept the Torah.

                            In both narrations above, Rabbi Dimi Bar Hama (3rd century AD) claims that Exodus 19:17 teaches that God actually lifted the mountain over the heads of Israelites, and forced them to accept the Covenant, or die.

                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Exodus 19:16-20</h5>

                                16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. <br>
                                17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; <b>and they stood at the nether part of the mount.</b> <br>
                                18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. <br>
                                19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. <br>
                                20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.

                            From the above, it seems Rabbi Dimi Bar Hama interpreted the Hebrew word takh-tee (תַּחְתִּי) in verse 17, here translated "nether part", to mean "underneath". In reality, it just describes the Israelites standing at the base of the mountain, but this kind of wordplay is very, very common in Jewish Midrash. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            But notice that contextually, Rabbi Hama's interpretation makes no sense. The Israelites had already accepted the Covenant (Exodus 19:5-9). The chapter even states that this event took place on the "third day" (Exodus 19:11, 19:15-16) after the Israelites accepted the Covenant.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            So, the mountain was not lifted above the heads of the Israelites, forcing them to accept the Covenant, or else be killed. This tradition in the Talmud is erroneous, yet it is incorporated into the Quran as if it happened, when it did not. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Quran's account of the Israelites being threatened by God with Mount Sinai raised above their heads is from post-Christian Jewish tradition, which is contextually impossible, given what the Biblical account actually states. Also, Muhammad's assertion that the Israelites said "We hear, and disobey", when being threatened, adds to the absurdity of the account.
