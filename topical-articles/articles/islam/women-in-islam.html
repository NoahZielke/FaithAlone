                        <h3>Teaching 1 - Most of those in Hell are Women</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In many Hadith, Muhammad said that he saw a vision of Hell, and that most of the inhabitants were women, and then gave reasons as to why that was the case:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Sahih al-Bukhari 1052</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "I saw Paradise and stretched my hands towards a bunch (of its fruits) and had I taken it, you would have eaten from it as long as the world remains. <b>I also saw the Hell-fire and I had never seen such a horrible sight. I saw that most of the inhabitants were women.</b>" <br> <br>
                                
                                The people asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Why is it so?" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "Because of their ungratefulness." It was asked whether they are ungrateful to Allah. The Prophet said, "They are ungrateful to their companions of life (husbands) and ungrateful to good deeds. If you are benevolent to one of them throughout the life and if she sees anything (undesirable) in you, she will say, 'I have never had any good from you.'"
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Sahih al-Bukhari 304</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: <br>
                                Once Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) of `Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by the women and said, <b>"O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women)."</b> They asked, "Why is it so, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ?" He replied, "You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you." <br> <br>
                                
                                The women asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What is deficient in our intelligence and religion?" He said, "Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?" They replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?" The women replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her religion."
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Notice <i>why</i> he says they are the majority in Hell, when asked. He did <i>not</i> say "because slightly more women are born than men". Rather, he generalizes women as "ungrateful", disrespectful to their husbands, even when their husbands are kind to them, and that they are "deficient in intelligence and religion".
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Also note that, oddly, he cites the fact that women cannot pray or fast during their menstruation - something that they cannot control - as the way in which they are "deficient in religion". 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Therefore, according to Muhammad, the gender that one is born with has a noticeable effect on whether or not they will go to Heaven when they die. None of these statements attacking women are ever qualified or given any scope. They are sweeping generalizations which slander and demean all women. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Also see Sahih al-Bukhari 29, 1462, 5196-97, 6449, and Sahih Muslim 79a-b, 2736, 2737a-d, 2738a-b, which all reiterate this teaching.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Teaching 2 - It is Permissible to Beat Women</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In the Quran, Muhammad commanded beating of one's wife in the standard progression of dealing with her disobedience:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Surah 4:34 (Asad)</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                34 Men shall take full care of women with the bounties which God has bestowed more abundantly on the former than on the latter, and with what they may spend out of their possessions. And the righteous women are the truly devout ones, who guard the intimacy which God has [ordained to be] guarded. And as for those women whose ill-will you have reason to fear, admonish them [first]; then leave them alone in bed; <b>then beat them;</b> and if thereupon they pay you heed, do not seek to harm them. Behold, God is indeed most high, great!
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Above, Muhammad claimed that God gave us these instructions when dealing with persistently disobedient wives:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:larger">
                            <li>First, give them a verbal warning</li>
                            <li>Second, deprive them of contact - leave them alone</li>
                            <li>Third, beat them</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Note that the translator's name is provided, because, as frequently happens, translators who have an agenda to make Islam seem less horrific to English speakers add commentary into the verse to soften what Muhammad actually taught - proving that they find what he taught appalling. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Those who translate the verse similarly to Muhammad Asad above are Maududi, Pickthall, Sahih International, Itani, and Haleem. All of these simply say to "strike", "hit", "beat", or "scourge" a women as a final step in punishing them. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            However, others add commentary into the verse by using brackets or parenthesis, because they felt qualified to <i>commentate</i> rather than <i>translate</i> in an attempt to soften what Muhammad commanded:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Surah 4:34 (Yusuf Ali)</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                34 Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband's) absence what Allah would have them guard. As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (Next), refuse to share their beds, (And last) <b>beat them (lightly);</b> but if they return to obedience, seek not against them Means (of annoyance): For Allah is Most High, great (above you all).
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The above verse does not say "lightly", rather, Yusuf Ali says "lightly". This has no bearing whatsoever on what Muhammad actually said or taught, and so pretending that this is a valid translation is deceptive. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Other translators that add a parenthetical "lightly" or "gently" into the verse are Khattab and Mushin Khan, with Laleh Bakhtiar <i>taking the entire part out about "beating" out of her translation entirely</i>.

                            This same practice is applied to stories in Hadith of Muhammad hitting Aisha, whom he married when she was nine years old<!--<a href="../islam/child-marriage.html" target="_blank">he married when she was nine years old</a>--> (Sahih al-Bukhari 5133, etc.). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In early English translations, both Sahih Muslim 974b and Sunan an-Nasai 2037 used to relay a narration from Aisha, where she said Muhammad "struck me on the chest, which caused me pain", after she had lied to him. In every modern translation of the Hadith, these verses have been updated to read "He gave me a nudge on the chest, which I felt".
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            There is also a narration of Aisha's father, and the First Rightly-Guided Caliph, Abu Bakr, hitting Aisha, even after she was married to Muhammad, which, just as with Muhammad, she remarked was painful:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Sahih al-Bukhari 6845</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                Narrated Aisha: <br>
                                <b>Abu Bakr came to towards me and struck me violently with his fist</b> and said, "You have detained the people because of your necklace." But I remained motionless as if I was dead lest I should awake Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) <b>although that hit was very painful.</b>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In Sahih al-Bukhari 4608, this is said to have been a hit to the chest. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            However, since Muhammad is not the one doing the hitting, the translators did not feel the need to update the first part of this to "he nudged me forcefully with his hand", and the last sentence to "I felt the nudge strongly", because they are hypocrites. Abu Bakr did not care about doing this in the presence of his warlord companion Muhammad, because Muhammed did the same, and taught that doing so was permissible. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Finally, one can look at a Hadith that documents the fact that Muslim women as a group were beaten, and treated worse than even their Pagan counterparts, according to Muslims themselves:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>

                                Narrated Ikrima: <br>
                                Rifa'a divorced his wife whereupon AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. Aisha said that the lady came, wearing a green veil, and complained to her of her husband and showed her a green spot on her skin caused by beating. It was the habit of ladies to support each other, so when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came, Aisha said, <b>"I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women. Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!"</b>
                            </p>

                            Above, a woman is being beaten by her husband, and Aisha remarks "I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women". Aisha's opinion on the matter is probably more relevant than the opinion of a 21st century Muslim apologist.

                            In some of the narrations seen in Teaching 1 above, Muhammad qualified <i>why</i> he taught that women were deficient in intellect. It was because they were only worth 1/2 of a man when testifying to a matter:

                            Once again, there is never an attempt in the context to narrow the scope of these statements. He simply makes blanket statements about women in general, and they are disparaging, belittling, and false.

                        <h3>Various Other Ways Women are Inferior in Islam</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            There are many other ways men are superior to women in Islam.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            An easy example of this would be the fact that men can have four wives, but women cannot have four husbands. In the Quran, women have no protection from divorce, and if enslaved, can be forced to have intercourse with their owners, even if they are married (Surah 4:24). Female genital mutilation is also practiced in Islam (Jami at-Tirmidhi 108-109, Sunan Abi Dawud 5271, Sunan Ibn Majah 608).

                            Muhammad was among the nastiest of history's "prophets" with respect to his teaching on women, and the above instances are not exhaustive, yet they make the case without needing much commentary, because what the sources say is so obviously misogynistic.
