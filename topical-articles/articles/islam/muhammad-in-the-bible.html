                        <h3>Muhammad's Claim of Being Prophesied to Come</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In the Quran, Muhammad made the following claim about the Torah and the Gospel:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Surah 7:157</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                157 Those who follow the Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet, <b>whom they find mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel in their possession.</b> He directs them to righteousness, and deters them from evil, ...
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <!-- He also mentioned that Jesus prophesied of him by name (Surah 61:6). However, even though there is no record of Jesus ever saying anything like this, Muslims will dismiss this with a hand wave, as it does not say that such a mention was ever written. -->
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This claim is important, because Muhammad is acknowledging that the Christians and Jews still have the Torah and the Gospel, and it is known beyond any doubt what the Torah and the Gospel looked like in the 7th century, because there are extant copies of the entire Bible from long before then.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This means that if Muhammad were here today, he would have to show a modern Christian or Jew, in the current Bible, where he is. Since he neglected to give the reference from either the Torah or the Gospel which was supposed to mention him, Muslims have undertaken this task, and proposed many verses over the years that allegedly vindicate Muhammad's claim.

                        <h3>Searching in a Hopelessly Corrupt Bible</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Before beginning, it is essential to understand the very strange view of the Bible that Muslims are forced into by the Quran. Muhammad affirmed the inspiration of the Torah and Gospel (Surah 3:3-4, 5:43-48, 5:68, etc.), he affirmed that the Torah was written with God's own hand (Sahih al-Bukhari 6614, Sahih Muslim 2652a), and he affirmed that none can change the words of God (Surah 6:114-115, 18:27). But, since he had no idea what the Bible taught, he proceeded to prolifically contradict it, on a whole host of doctrines. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            As later Muslims got more familiar with the Bible, and found that it did not affirm what Muhammad taught at all, they were forced to repudiate their own prophet, and claim that the Bible had been so completely corrupted that almost every verse in every chapter had been altered, or lost, and as a result, only the Quran was to be trusted. Verses like Surah 7:157, however, have them searching through what they believe is a hopelessly corrupt, Satanic, forged scripture, trying to find something that they can nonetheless claim is a divinely-inspired prophesy that Muhammad said would be there. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This view of the Biblical text means that every Muslim proposal that will be discussed below is a non-starter. A Muslim has no basis from which to prove that every last verse below isn't a part of the wholesale corruption that they assert has overtaken the entire Bible.

                        <h3>Genesis 17:20</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Muslims assert that because Muhammad was descended from Ishmael, the blessing of Ishmael in verse 20 below is a prophecy of Muhammad, and so is the reiteration of that blessing in Genesis 21:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Genesis 17:19-21</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                19 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him. <br>
                                20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. <br>
                                21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
                            </p>

                                12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. <br>
                                13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed. <br>
                                17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. <br>
                                18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Firstly, the nature of the blessing on Ishmael was that God was to "multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation". This was fulfilled during the life of Ishmael (Genesis 25:12-16), and has nothing to do with Muhammad.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Muslims assert that "great" must mean something like "noble", and was therefore yet to be fulfilled, demonstrating their complete ignorance of the Bible, because that is not what that term means at all, which in this context describes size (Deuteronomy 2:10, 2:21, 7:1, 9:1, 11:23, Joshua 23:9, Jeremiah 6:22-23, etc.), not nobility or morality. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Secondly, above, the context of all of the passages is included in order to demonstrate that they all describe Ishmael's <i>rejection</i> by God, and God's covenant being made with Isaac instead. In fact, Ishmael was so rejected, that God repeatedly called Isaac Abraham's "only son" (Genesis 22:2, 22:12, 22:16). Therefore, Ishmael is not even in the Biblical line of Abraham. He is prophetically meaningless, and no prophets ever came from him.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Some Muslims have attempted to salvage this situation, by asserting that the following verse from the book of Matthew is in reference to Ishmaelites becoming the chosen of God:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Matthew 21:43</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                43 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This is the <i>definition</i> of Scripture twisting. The only possible way someone could think that this verse applies to Ishmaelites in Arabia 600 years later is if they burned the rest of the New Testament, and pretended that this verse fell out of the sky.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This verse refers to the fact that God's nation in the New Testament consists of all believers in Jesus Christ (Acts 15:13-19, Ephesians 2:11-13, 19), no longer bound by the carnal ordinances of the Abrahamic or Mosaic covenant:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">1 Peter 2:5, 9-10</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                5 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. <br>
                                9 <b>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people;</b> that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: <br>
                                10 <b>Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God:</b> which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            It was prophesied in the Old Testament that God would bring Gentiles into His chosen people (Hosea 2:23). Then Jesus Christ comes to earth, is born of a virgin, dies for the sins of mankind, rises from the dead, and opens the door of the New Covenant to all nations (Matthew 28:19, Romans 9:25-26), just as prophesied. Therefore, the kingdom is taken from the unbelieving Jews, and given to all believers in Jesus (Acts 28:25-29).
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            To reiterate, the idea that Matthew 21:43 is God designating Ishmaelites - who are not found in any context anywhere - as His new covenant people, is the height of dishonesty, only demonstrating how desperate the Muslim position is to have to resort to such an argument.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In summary, the blessings on Ishmael were fulfilled 2,000 years before Muhammad was born, and were part of God's explicit <i>rejection</i> of Ishmael in favor of Isaac. If Muhammad was a descendant of Ishmael, that would be utterly meaningless.

                            And, as covered above, God's covenant was made with the Jews, <i>not</i> the Ishmaelites (Exodus 19:1-24:8). Hagar and her son Ishmael were cast out from Abraham, specifically because the chosen seed was Isaac, not Ishmael (Genesis 17:19-21, 21:10-12) - which prophesied the New Covenant which would be ushered in 2,000 years later (Galatians 4:22-31). Jesus Christ, the promised seed (Genesis 3:15), came from Isaac (Matthew 1:2, Luke 3:34), and <i>not</i> Ishmael. And, it was Jesus Christ who fulfilled this prophecy (Acts 3:22-26, 7:37, 7:52), having met all the criteria for fulfillment over 500 years before Muhammad was born.

                            Muslims - most famously, Ahmed Deedat - will rattle off similarities between Moses and Muhammad, in an attempt to establish Muhammad as being "like Moses". However, notice <i>in what sense</i> the prophet would be "like Moses", in verse 16. He would be an intermediary between God and the people, who were terrified of God's presence, and speak to the Lord face-to-face on their behalf (Exodus 33:11, Numbers 12:6-8). This is face-to-face interaction with God is the mark of this prophet, as a parallel passage at the end of the same book teaches clearly:

                        <blockquote>

                            Notice, "the prophet like Moses" is specifically described as one who would be "in Israel", "whom the Lord knew face to face", and was mighty in "signs and wonders". All of this describes Jesus Christ, and His relationship to the Father (Matthew 11:27, Luke 10:22). None of this describes Muhammad, who was not in Israel, denied that he was a miracle-worker (Surah 6:37, 10:20, 13:7, 17:59, 29:48-51, etc.), and didn't even claim to speak directly to God, or hear directly from God, but rather an angel. <!-- Sahih al-Bukhari 4855 -->

                            Muslims assert that verse 2 of this passage refers to Muhammad conquering Mecca - which they also assert is referred to as "Paran" - with 10,000 soldiers in the year 630 AD. Further, Paran is where Ishmael settled (Genesis 21:21), and Muhammad is claimed to be a descendant from Ishmael. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Firstly, this is not a prophecy. It is a blessing that Moses gave to the people before he died. In it, he references Seir, and Paran, places which they had just visited during the Exodus (Numbers 10:12, 12:16, 13:3, Deuteronomy 2:1-29), and he is describing what God <i>already</i> did there. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            From Biblical references, it is known that Paran is between Midian and Egypt (1 Kings 11:18, Genesis 21:21), and near Kadesh (Numbers 13:26), Laban (Ashnah), Tophel, Hazeroth, and Dizahab (Deuteronomy 1:1), placing it either next to, or in the <i>Sinai Peninsula</i>, nowhere near Mecca or Medina. Published maps of the Israelites' wandering in the wilderness do not put them anywhere near Medina, let alone Mecca, yet they visited Paran during that journey. So, Paran is not Mecca, nor Medina, and neither of those places have any Biblical link to Ishmael.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Secondly, it says "The Lord" (YHWH) shined forth from Mount Paran. Muhammad knows nothing about the name of God used here, having shunned it entirely, as covered in <a href="../islam/name-of-god.html" target="_blank">this article</a>. Since this verse uses a name of God that Muhammad rejected, it definitely does not prophesy of him. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Thirdly, the verse does not say "10,000 soldiers". It says <i>"ten thousands"</i> - plural - of His saints. This means a multiple of 10,000, and refers in context to the millions of Israelites (Deuteronomy 33:3, Exodus 12:37), who were with Moses, used as a type of the Heavenly host of that is with God in Heaven, also referred to with this same type of language (Psalm 68:16-17, Daniel 7:9-10, Jude 1:14). If it were referring to Muhammad's army of 10,000 which overtook Mecca, there would be no need for the plural. The plural here is used to indicate a practically innumerable multitude. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Finally, the "Law" mentioned in verse 2 refers in context to the Law of Moses (Deuteronomy 33:4), given during the Exodus (Exodus 20, Deuteronomy 5), and not the Quran. The Quran contradicts many points of God's actual Law as revealed during the Exodus, including commanding people to do something which God directly calls an "abomination" (Surah 2:230, Deuteronomy 24:1-4).
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In summary, this verse is a reflection on what God had already done at that point in the Exodus, in a land nowhere near Muhammad, having a name which Muhammad was ignorant of, and a giving a Law which Muhammad demanded his followers to contradict in scores of different ways. This kind of reflection is done elsewhere in Scripture (Judges 5:4-5, Psalms 68:7-8). Every aspect of this passage has a very clear, easily understood Biblical context referencing what had just happened in the Exodus, which has to be entirely ignored, in order to try to make it a prophecy about Muhammad, which it is definitely not.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Note also, that this is the last verse in the Torah that Muslims reference with any degree of regularity as pertaining to Muhammad. This means that this article could end right here, and declare Surah 7:157 to be false, because Muhammad is definitely, indisputably <i>not</i> found in the Torah. However, the other proposed verses from outside of the Torah will be covered as well, in order to demonstrate that Muhammad definitely is not there, either.

                            Muslims assert that the "valley of Baca" in verse 6 refers to Mecca, and the "well" refers to the Zamzam well in Mecca.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Firstly, this does not refer to Muhammad, because even if every Muslim claim about this passage is granted, Muhammad is nowhere to be found. Muhammad's claim was that <i>he</i> would be found mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel - not Mecca, and not the Zamzam well.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Secondly, this does not refer to Muhammad, because yet again, "The Lord" (YHWH) is used seven times in this short chapter - a name that Muhammad never demonstrated any awareness of.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Thirdly, the passage says that "every one" of those who went to the valley of Baca "appears in Zion before God". The name "Zion" refers to Jerusalem specifically (Isaiah 40:9), or Israel more broadly (Zechariah 9:13), in every instance in which it is used in the Old Testament, which is often. If we take the <i>southernmost</i> tip of Israel, it is still over 1,100 kilometers away from Mecca. Add another 200 kilometers, if Zion is referring to Jerusalem. Attempting to link the two locations, such that all who are in one come into the other, is geographically impossible, and defies common sense. 
                        </p>
                        <!-- <p class="article-body">
                            This leads us to the obvious conclusion that not every place that has ever been called "Baca" refers to Mecca, which didn't appear on any map until over 2,000 years after this Psalm was written, and is definitely <i>not</i> what is being referenced here. 
                        </p> -->
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Fourthly, the passage does not say "they make a pilgrimage to Baca", it says that they "pass through the valley of Baca", on their way to Zion. It is a thoroughfare, not the destination. The destination is Zion. Where did Jews live, when this was written? They lived in Israel. So, this was a valley, <i>within</i> Israel, that Jews would go through on their way to Jerusalem. Why would Jews, who lived in Israel, take a 2,500 kilometer round-trip detour, on their pilgrimage to Jerusalem?
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Fifthly, the passage does not say "there is a well in Baca". It says "those passing through the valley of Baca <i>make it</i> a well; the rain also filleth the pools". This is referring to people digging <i>places</i> - plural - for rainwater to accumulate, or digging into sand until they reach a waterline, which doesn't describe the Zamzam well at all. <!--Pilgrims to Mecca don't "make" the Zamzam well, because according to Muslim tradition, it was created by God at the time of Abraham.--> Some also interpret this verse metaphorically, as valley of Baca is sometimes translated "valley of weeping", and this could in that case refer to the (happy or sad) tears of the pilgrims. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Finally, there is <!--<a href="../islam/islams-kaaba-problem.html" target="_blank">the Kaaba problem</a>-->the Kaaba problem. Muslims believe that the Kaaba in Mecca was God's first and most important shine on the entire planet, and was appointed as the place of worship for all of mankind by God during the life of Abraham (Surah 22:25-29). So, even if against all reason, we grant Muslims this passage in Psalms, why does the Kaaba only receive one obscure mention in the entire Bible? And why, instead, are there thousands and thousands of references to Israel, Jerusalem, the Temple, and the Tabernacle?
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In summary, the valley of Baca, sometimes translated "valley of Weeping", was likely a valley just outside of Jerusalem. It is definitely <i>not</i> the city of Mecca, over 1,100 kilometers away. Even if it were to be about Mecca, that would say nothing about Muhammad, and whether he was God's prophet, for the same reason that all the Biblical mentions of Judea don't make Judas Iscariot - who preached in Judea - God's prophet.

                            Very common amongst Muslims, because of its usage by Zakir Naik, is the argument that Song of Solomon chapter 5 refers to Muhammad by name:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Muslims argue that because the Hebrew word for "lovely" is pronounced "machmâd" (מַחְמָד), and that sounds like "Muhammad", this is Muhammad being referred to by name in the Old Testament.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Firstly, the Hebrew word is <i>plural</i> in this sentence - "maḥămaddîm" (מַחֲּמַדִּ֑ים). This means that Muslims are asserting that Solomon's bride is saying "He is altogether (multiple) Muhammads". It makes no sense to use a proper noun like this, because that is not what is being done here. And, Muslims have to <i>change</i> the word into its singular form, because it makes no sense to use the plural to refer to Muhammad either.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Secondly, the context of this passage has nothing to do with Muhammad, or Allah. It says nothing at all about Muhammad's life, message, or anything of the sort. Instead, this is simply taking a word in another language, and asserting that it refers to someone entirely absent from <i>any</i> context, because it sounds similar to their name.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">

                                16 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail: <br>
                                17 And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken it.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Muslims assert that verse 15 refers to Muhammad's flight from Mecca to Medina, and then verses 16 and 17 refer to his conquering of Mecca. They also link Muhammad to Tema, and Kedar, who are two of Ishmael's sons (Genesis 25:13-15). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Firstly, establishing the context of this passage is important. It is nestled within an eleven chapter section in Isaiah, where from chapter 13-24, God pronounces judgement on the nations around Israel, including Babylon (Isaiah 13-14), Moab (Isaiah 15-16), Damascus (Isaiah 17-18), Egypt (Isaiah 19-20), the desert (Isaiah 21), Israel itself (Isaiah 22), and Tyre (Isaiah 23). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This means that any location near Israel was going to be mentioned in this section of Isaiah. Arabia being mentioned is not unique, nor is it remarkable. All of these judgments came to pass in the life of Isaiah, and the judgment in the passage in question happened "within a year" (Isaiah 21:16) of the prophecy being given, meaning it was completed over 1,000 years before Muhammad was born. <!--The judgment pronounced on Moab is similarly limited by a strict time frame (Isaiah 16:14).-->
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Muslims cannot simply ignore the "within a year" stipulation, just as Moabites could not ignore the "within 3 years" stipulation for their prophecy (Isaiah 16:14). If Muslims want to make verses 14 and 15 about Muhammad's flight to Medina from Mecca, that happened in 622 AD. Then, if verses 16 and 17 refer to him conquering Mecca, that happened in 630 AD - 8 years later. Therefore, trying to impose this passage on those two events doesn't match, because the time frame given in the passage was exceeded by a factor of 8.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Secondly, in verse 16, "The Lord" (YHWH) is used. Since Muhammad <a href="../islam/name-of-god.html" target="_blank">rejected that name</a> in favor of his own name for God, and never preached under that name at any point in his life, this is definitely not a prophecy of him. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Thirdly, Muslims view Muhammad's conquest of Mecca as a <i>good thing</i> - restoring the inhabitants of the land to worship of the one true God, and bringing Monotheism back to his hometown. So, if verses 16 and 17 refer to Muhammad taking Mecca, what sense would it make to say "all the glory of Kedar shall fail", when restoring them to Monotheism is the most glorious thing that any Muslim could want to happen to any people group?
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In summary, this was a prophecy which came to pass in the life of Isaiah, in the time frame specified by the Lord (YHWH) in the passage. It brought about a curse on the people of the land, not a blessing. Therefore, in order to twist this passage to affirm Muhammad, Muslims had to ignore the name of the Lord, they had to ignore the time frame given in the passage, and they had to declare that Muhammad cursed the Kedarites when he conquered them, and restored them to worship of Allah.

                                11 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed: <br>

                                13 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:

                            Muslims assert that verse 12 is a reference to Muhammad, who said "I cannot read", when told to read by the angel Gabriel, when Gabriel first appeared to him in a cave - even though many translations of various accounts of the event render what he said "I do not recite". 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            However, this is one of the <i>last</i> passages that a Muslim would want to be about Muhammad. In context, this is describing <i>disobedient</i> sinners who are spiritually blinded, and are <i>rejecting</i> what God is telling them to do. The ones that can read cannot understand, and the ones who cannot read do not bother to learn, so the Lord says they "have removed their heart far from me".

                        <p class="article-body">
                            This passage is quoted by Jesus Christ in the New Testament as representing hypocrites and false teachers, who taught man's commandments as if they were God's:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>

                                5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? <br>
                                6 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. <br>

                                1 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. <br>
                                2 He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. <br>
                                3 A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth. <br>
                                4 He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law. <br>
                                5 Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein: <br>

                                11 Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains. <br>
                                12 Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands. <br>
                                13 The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.

                            Their assertion that this refers to Muhammad hinges on verse 11's reference to Kedar, who again, is one of Ishmael's sons (Genesis 25:13). The pattern, by now, if it has not become obvious, is that Muslims are simply trying to link anything and everything in the Bible that references Ishmael to Muhammad, even though by doing so, they have disqualified him as an Abrahamic prophet altogether (Genesis 17:19-21, 21:10-12). No covenant was made with Ishmael. He was rejected. He is prophetically irrelevant, except to serve as an example of bondage to "the Law of sin and death" (Galatians 4:22-31, Romans 8:2). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Further, Muslims' assertion that Muhammad was an Ishmaelite cannot even be substantiated. The genealogies that Muslims give of Muhammad, which are forged, and created long after he died, only have about 25 generations between him and Ishmael. They lived <i>2,500 years</i> apart. That means that, being extremely generous, approximately 60% of the names are missing from his genealogy, even if one were to assume that the names given are real.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Coming to the passage in question, in the first place, this could not be a prophecy of Muhammad, because <i>six times</i> in this passage, "The Lord" (YHWH) is used. <a href="../islam/name-of-god.html" target="_blank">Muhammad rejected this name</a>, in favor of his own name for God. Therefore, this is another non-starter, just as the other five passages discussed so far that use the Lord's name. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Secondly, verse 4 says that "he shall not fail, nor be discouraged". Muhammad got so discouraged that he repeatedly went to kill himself by jumping off a mountain, multiple times throughout his prophetic career (Sahih al-Bukhari 6982). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Thirdly, the reference to Kedar is being used as an example of the Gentiles - mentioned repeatedly in the passage (Isaiah 42:1, 4, 6) - who are going to have the Gospel preached to them, and this passage is fulfilled in Acts 13:46-47, demonstrating the "servant" to be none other than Jesus Christ. Salvation is of the Jews (John 4:22), not the Kedarites, or the Ishmaelites.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Finally - and this applies to all passages from Isaiah above, as well - Muslims have no right to even attempt to quote the book of Isaiah, because it calls God "our Father" (Isaiah 63:16, 64:8) - something that Muhammad rejected, and considered blasphemous (Surah 5:18, 19:88-92, etc.). This could be done with every single book of the Bible that Muslims try to quote in support of Muhammad.

                            So, to be clear, in Habakkuk 3:3, the statement "God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran", has a single subject - God. God is "the Holy One" mentioned in the verse (Ezekiel 39:7, Hosea 11:9), as the same book also demonstrates clearly:
                        </p>

                            That is why the rest of chapter 3 goes on to describe God. Notice how Habakkuk 3:3 continues, after mentioning "the Holy One" - "His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise". The antecedent for this is "the Holy One". Applying this to a human being, like Muhammad, is idolatry.

                            Muslims assert that verse 7 below refers to Muhammad, using a similar argument to that used for the Song of Solomon passage, in which they find Muhammad in the Hebrew word for "desire", "chemdâh" (חֶמְדָּה):

                            This argument is somehow even weaker than the argument from the passage in Song of Solomon. Unlike that passage, "chemdâh" does not even really sound like "Muhammad". Even if it did, that would be meaningless, for all of the same reasons that it was meaningless in Song of Solomon 5:16. 
                        </p>

                            Further, the "this house" mentioned in verse 7 refers to the second Temple in Jerusalem, as is understood by reading the rest of the book (Haggai 1:2, 1:14, 2:3, 2:9). The second Temple was destroyed in 70 AD, 500 years before Muhammad was born, precluding any idea that he is anywhere in this passage. Jesus, however, visited the Temple on multiple occasions, and by His presence, and ushering in of the New Covenant (Matthew 27:51), made the second Temple to excel the first (Haggai 2:9).

                            Finally, that ever-present name of "The Lord" (YHWH) once again makes an appearance, testifying that Muhammad had no idea what God he was even trying to affirm, when he discarded that name in favor of his own name for God.

                                19 And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? <br>
                                20 And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. <br>
                                21 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Muslims, who acknowledge that Jesus is the Messiah (Surah 3:45, etc.), point out that the Jews asked about the Messiah and "that prophet" <i>separately</i>, therefore, they are not one in the same, and Muhammad is "that prophet" - a reference to the "prophet like Moses", already discussed above in the section on Deuteronomy 18:15-19.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Firstly, the Jews present with John the Baptist in John chapter 1 are not an authoritative source of doctrine for Christians. Jews said a lot of things in the Gospels, including denying that Jesus was the Messiah (Luke 23:35), accusing Him of trying to overthrow the government (Luke 23:2), and saying He is demon-possessed (Matthew 9:34). However, if we <i>were</i> going off of the testimony of the Jews, we would have to conclude that Jesus was "that prophet", because that is what they later testified en masse, according to the same book:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>

                                14 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, <b>This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.</b>
                            </p>

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Jesus, and <i>not</i> Muhammad, is "the prophet like Moses" for all of the same reasons discussed in the aforementioned section on Deuteronomy 18. He is identified as such explicitly by the Apostles (Acts 3:22-26, 7:37, 7:52) - first-century Jews whose opinions Christians actually regard.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Recall that in Surah 7:157, Muhammad said that "they", meaning Christians, would find him mentioned in the Gospel that they have in their possession. Christians, when looking for doctrine, would never use the words of random Jews to contravene a clear statement of an Apostle, and the testimony of the rest of Jesus Christ's ministry concerning His fulfillment of being the "prophet like Moses". So, the idea that honest Christians examining their own Scripture would see Muhammad in this is, once again, absurd.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Secondly, this is one of the worst chapters for a Muslim to ever find themselves in. God is called "The Father" twice in this chapter (John 1:14, 18), Jesus is called His Son (John 1:14, 18, 34, 49), and readers are told that they can become the sons of God by faith in Christ (John 1:12).
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In summary, Muslims cannot be faithful to anything in John chapter 1, or deal honestly with the text in question, when trying to find Muhammad where he is definitely not present.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Firstly, in John 14 through 16, Jesus calls God "The Father" no less than 45 times, something which Muhammad taught was sinful and blasphemous (Surah 5:18, 19:88-92, etc.). All of the passages mentioning the Comforter also have the Father in the immediate context, or even the same sentence. Jesus also teaches in chapter 14 that "no man comes to the Father, but by me" (John 14:6), and that He answers prayers (John 14:13-14) - two things that Muhammad would have deemed extremely blasphemous. So, how could any of this be used as a prophecy of Muhammad? What is the point of playing this game where a text that violently contradicts everything Muslims are saying can actually be used as proof that they are correct, so long as most of its context - and the entire rest of the book that it is from - is thrown away and ignored? <i>Anyone</i> could do that with <i>any</i> text to support <i>any</i> belief.
                        </p>

                            Thirdly, everything in the context of these chapters demonstrates that this was something that was going to happen to the <i>disciples themselves</i>, in their lifetime. He is directly addressing His disciples, and telling them that the Comforter will come to <i>them</i>, so that God continues to abide with them, even though Christ ascends to the Father:

                            Fourthly, the things that the Comforter is described as doing could definitely not be said of Muhammad. Did Muhammad "abide with" the disciples "forever" (John 14:16)? Was Muhammad "dwelling with" them, soon to be "in them" (John 14:17)? Is Muhammad "The Spirit of truth", which the world cannot see (John 14:17)? Did Muhammad teach the disciples "all things" (John 14:26), and guide them into "all truth" (John 16:13)? No, because Muhammad is not the Holy Spirit, who is being referred to here, and who came <i>during the lives</i> of the disciples, fulfilling these chapters (John 20:22, Acts 2:1-4, Ephesians 1:12-14, etc.).

                            Fifthly, Jesus said that He, in conjunction with the Father, "will send" the Comforter (John 15:26, 16:7). Do Muslims believe that Jesus sent Muhammad? No, rather, they believe Jesus is beneath Muhammad, as although Jesus was a prophet, Muhammad is the Seal of the Prophets (Surah 33:40).
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Finally, it is important to focus again on the fact that Surah 7:157 that <i>Christians</i> would find Muhammad mentioned in the Gospel that they have in their possession. Could any honest Christian, reading their own Scriptures in context, conclude that that is true? No. Rather, only a <i>dishonest</i> Christian, who is fine <i>twisting, distorting, and ignoring</i> what their Scriptures say, could arrive at Muhammad in the Gospels. Is that what Allah, the God of the universe, was expecting Christians to do?

                            This is the single go-to passage in the New Testament for Muslims trying to find prophecies of Muhammad. It is ridiculous, in the true sense of the word, that anyone would try to make any part of this refer to Muhammad. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Muhammad made a claim, that claim has been tested, and found to be false. After 14 centuries of looking, Muslims are unable to produce a single verse of Scripture which could even <i>potentially</i> be about Muhammad. And, in order to satisfy the criteria of Muhammad's claim, they would need one in <i>both</i> the Torah and Gospel.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            In the New Testament, when an Old Testament prophecy is fulfilled, the Old Testament passage in focus is often <i>quoted</i>, allowing the reader to know exactly what the author had in mind. Muhammad was totally silent on which verses supposedly affirmed him, because he had no idea himself, having, at best, an oral familiarity with certain parts of the Bible.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Muslim apologists are able to pull the wool over the eyes of their followers, for the sole reason that those followers have never read the Bible. Therefore, a few verses like the above, twisted to create an apparition of their prophet, seems plausible to them. But, the Bible is a very long book. It is about ten times longer than the Quran. And, actually reading it in its entirety reveals themes that permeate the Old and New Testaments - priesthood, covenants, God as Father, blood atonement, the Messiah, and so on. It is coherent, self-contained, and has a focused narrative from Genesis to Revelation. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Anyone who actually reads this narrative will understand that it leaves absolutely no room for anyone like Muhammad. He is totally remote from the Biblical story which culminates so clearly in Jesus Christ, and the religion that he invented is <a href="../islam/biblical-themes.html" target="_blank">barren of any of the Biblical themes shared so intimately between the Old and New Testaments</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The truthfulness of the Quran depends on this claim being true, and we know for a fact that it is not - and can easily demonstrate that every such verse that has ever been, or will ever be proposed to defend the claim is being grossly misused. Therefore, the Quran is not from God, and Islam is false. Surah 7:157 is an indefensible, false claim. Another 14 centuries will not change the fact that despite his claims, Muhammad is nowhere in the Bible.

                                Some Muslim scholars cite Deuteronomy 18:15-18 <!--break-->and 33:2, Isaiah 42, and John 14:16 as examples of the description of Prophet Muḥammad in the Bible. However, Bible scholars interpret these verses differently. The name of Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ) appears several times in the Gospel of Barnabas, which is deemed apocryphal by Christian authorities.

                                Aḥmad is another name for Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ). Both are derived from ḥa-ma-da which means 'praise.' Some Muslim scholars believe this verse refers to John 14:16, where Jesus says: "And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another periklytos, to be with you forever." Periklytos is a Greek word that means 'the praised one.' The name of Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ) appears several times in the Gospel of Barnabas, which is deemed apocryphal by Christian authorities.

                            Above, Khattab cites Deuteronomy 18:15-18, 33:2, Isaiah 42, and John 14:16, all of which are addressed above. He then cites the Gospel of Barnabas, a forgery written in Italian or Spanish over 1,000 years after the real Barnabas died, which has Jesus Christ denying that He is the Messiah (Chapter 42, 82, 97, 198<!--, yet calls him the "Christ" in Chapter 6, indicating that the forger had no idea that these two words were the same, and like Muhammad, did not know what they meant-->), and has Adam reciting the Shahada (Chapter 39, 41).

                            Lastly, he says "Periklytos is a Greek word that means 'the praised one'", deceptively citing that word, without a note, as if it is in the Greek text of the Gospel of John, when it is not. The Greek word in the passage in question is Paraklētos (παράκλητος), which according to Strong's Concordance, means, "an intercessor, consoler: advocate, comforter". According to Thayer's Greek Lexicon, "one who pleads another's cause before a judge, a pleader, counsel for defense, legal assistant; an advocate:", and universally, "one who pleads another's cause with one, an intercessor". Khattab's assertion, which amounts to deception, as he misrepresents the text of Scripture without a note, as if the Greek says Periclytos (περικλυτός), when it actually says Paraklētos (παράκλητος), will be addressed more below.

                                In this verse is a prefiguring, to Moses, of the Arabian Messenger, the last and greatest of the Messengers of Allah. Prophecies about him will be found in the Tawrah and the Injil. In the reflex of the Tawrah as now accepted by the Jews, Moses says: "The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me" (Deut. 18:15): the only Prophet who brought a Shari'ah like that of Moses was Muhammad al Mustafa, and he came of the house of Isma'il, the brother of Isaac, the father of Israel. In the reflex of the Gospel as now accepted by the Christians, Christ promised another Comforter, (John 14:16): the Greek word Paraclete which the Christians interpret as referring to the Holy Spirit is by our Doctors taken to be Periclyte, which would be the Greek form of Ahmad. See 61:6 and n. 416 to 3:81.

                                "Ahmad", or "Muhammad", the Praised One, is almost a translation of the Greek word Periclytos. In the present Gospel of John, 14:16, 15:26, and 16:7, the word "Comforter" in the English version is for the Greek word "Paracletos", which means "Advocate", "one called to the help of another, a kind friend", rather than "Comforter". Our doctors contend that Paracletos is a corrupt reading for Periclytos, and that in their original saying of Jesus there was a prophecy of our Prophet Ahmad by name. Even if we read Paraclete, it would apply to the Prophet, who is "a Mercy for all creatures" (21:107) and "most kind and merciful to the Believers" (9:128). See also n. 416 to 3:81.

                            Above, Ali cites Deuteronomy 18:15, and John 14:16, both of which are addressed above.

                            Ali then explains the Greek-based argument that Khattab deceptively glossed over in his commentary, asserting that the word found in the Gospel of John, Paraklētos (παράκλητος), is actually a corruption of Periclytos (περικλυτός), which means "the praised one" - just like Muhammad, which means "the praised one". A problem with this, beyond the contextual impossibilities discussed in the main article above, is that there is no Greek manuscript evidence for this reading. And, if it were corrupted, it could not be a single mistake in one verse, but rather, it would need to be corrupted in John 14:16, 14:26, 15:26, and 16:7, <i>in every extant manuscript of the Gospel of John</i>, which would definitely need to be purposeful. But, since the New Testament was never subjected to controlled transmission, and instead had free transmission amongst dispersed groups, and since there is no reason for someone to intentionally corrupt "the Advocate" to "the praised one", not knowing of Muhammad, who was to come in 500 years, this Muslim claim can be soundly dismissed.

                            Recall that Muhammad said that Christians would be the ones to find him mentioned in their Gospel. The Gospel of John <i>contextually</i> disallows Muhammad here, even if his name were exactly mentioned throughout - but not even that is present.

                                The interpolation of the words "later on" before the reference to the Gospel is necessitated by the fact that the whole of this passage is addressed to Moses and the children of Israel, that is, long before the Gospel (in the Qur'anic sense of this term - cf. surah 3, note 4) was revealed to Jesus. The stories of some of the earlier prophets given in this surah - beginning with the story of Noah and ending with that of Moses and the children of Israel - constitute a kind of introduction to this command to follow the "unlettered Prophet", Muhammad. The stress on his having been "unlettered" (ummi), i.e., unable to read and write, serves to bring out the fact that all his knowledge of the earlier prophets and of the messages transmitted by them was due to divine inspiration alone, and not to a familiarity with the Bible as such. For the Old Testament predictions of the advent of the Prophet Muhammad (especially in Deuteronomy xviii, 15 and 18), see surah 2, note 33; for the New Testament prophecies to the same effect, see 61:6 and the corresponding note.

                            <p class="mb-1">
                                This prediction is supported by several references in the Gospel of St. John to the Parakletos (usually rendered as "Comforter") who was to come after Jesus. This designation is almost certainly a corruption of Periklytos ("the Much-Praised"), an exact Greek translation of the Aramaic term or name Mawhamana. (It is to be borne in mind that Aramaic was the language used in Palestine at the time of, and for some centuries after, Jesus, and was thus undoubtedly the language in which the original - now lost - texts of the Gospels were composed). In view of the phonetic closeness of Periklytos and Parakletos it is easy to understand how the translator - or, more probably, a later scribe - confused these two expressions. It is significant that both the Aramaic Mawhamana and the Greek Periklytos have the same meaning as the two names of the Last Prophet, Muhammad and Ahmad, both of which are derived from the verb hamida ("he praised") and the noun hamd ("praise"). An even more unequivocal prediction of the advent of the Prophet Muhammad - mentioned by name, in its Arabic form - is said to be forthcoming from the so-called Gospel of St. Barnabas, which, though now regarded as apocryphal, was accepted as authentic and was read in the churches until the year 496 of the Christian era, when it was banned as "heretical" by a decree of Pope Gelasius. However, since the original text of that Gospel is not available (having come down to us only in an Italian translation dating from the late sixteenth century), its authenticity cannot be established with certainty.

                            Above, Asad cites Deuteronomy 18:15, 18:18, and John 14-16, which are addressed above. He repeats the same unsubstantiated assertion as Ali - that the word Paraklētos (παράκλητος) was a corruption of Periclytos (περικλυτός), in each of the four places it appears in John 14-16. Along with this, he claims that Aramaic, not Greek, was "undoubtedly the language in which the original - now lost - texts of the Gospels were composed" - a conclusion that is contrary to all scholarly consensus on the topic.

                            He then, as Khattab, references the Gospel of Barnabas, asserting that the 13th century forgery written in Italian or Spanish, in which Adam recites the Shahada, is actually the same Gospel of Barnabas condemned in the Decretum Gelasianum of Pope Gelasius I (496 AD), and that it was "accepted as authentic and was read in the churches" before then. He presents no evidence for the claim that the Gospel of Barnabas was ever "accepted as authentic and was read in the churches" (it is, for instance, absent entirely from Athanasius's 39th Festal Letter [367 AD], which lists books appointed to be read in churches - even non-canonical books), and no evidence that his desired Gospel of Barnabas is the one referenced in the Decretum Gelasianum, beyond their shared name. Asad does not provide a single patristic citation of his desired version of the Gospel of Barnabas existing in that period, though it is extremely long, and mentions Muhammad prolifically, unlike any other text that is known of the early periods of Christianity before, or even after Muhammad. It is impossible that Asad's desired version of the Gospel of Barnabas, if it were ever accepted, or existed before the late Middle Ages, would go unquoted in the thousands of pages of patristic works from the Apostolic era to the late Middle Ages, leave no manuscript evidence in the relevant languages, not be utilized by "God" supposedly in the Quran and also later Muslims via extensive citations, and so on.
