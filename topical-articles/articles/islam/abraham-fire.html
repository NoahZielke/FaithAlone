                        <p class="article-body">
                            In the Quran, an account is given of Abraham rebuking idol worship, and then being delivered from fire that Pagans tried to burn him with:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Surah 21:51-70</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                51 We gave Abraham his integrity formerly, and We knew him well. <br>
                                52 When he said to his father and his people, "What are these statues to which you are devoted?" <br>
                                53 They said, "We found our parents worshiping them." <br>
                                54 He said, "You and your parents are in evident error." <br>
                                55 They said, "Are you telling us the truth, or are you just playing?" <br>
                                56 He said, "Your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the One who created them, and I bear witness to that. <br>
                                57 "By God, I will have a plan for your statues after you have gone away." <br>
                                58 So he reduced them into pieces, except for their biggest, that they may return to it. <br>
                                59 They said, "Who did this to our gods? He is certainly one of the wrongdoers." <br>
                                60 They said, "We heard a youth mentioning them. He is called Abraham." <br>
                                61 They said, "Bring him before the eyes of the people, so that they may witness." <br>
                                62 They said, "Are you the one who did this to our gods, O Abraham?" <br>
                                63 He said, "But it was this biggest of them that did it. Ask them, if they can speak." <br>
                                64 Then they turned to one another, and said, "You yourselves are the wrongdoers." <br>
                                65 But they reverted to their old ideas: "You certainly know that these do not speak." <br>
                                66 He said, "Do you worship, instead of God, what can neither benefit you in anything, nor harm you? <br>
                                67 Shame on you, and on what you worship instead of God. Do you not understand?" <br>
                                68 They said, "Burn him and support your gods, if you are going to act." <br>
                                69 We said, "O fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham." <br>
                                70 They planned to harm him, but We made them the worst losers.

                            The word "Ur" is a Babylonian word for "city", and also was the name of a particular city in Sumer. However, Ur has the same consonantal structure as a Hebrew word for "light" (אוֹר) that in Aramaic means "fire". This led some to interpret this verse as saying that God delivered Abraham "out of the fire" of the Chaldeans.

                            This tradition is preserved in Genesis Rabbah, a Jewish commentary (Midrash) on the book of Genesis, dating from 300-500 AD. While even the most conservative date of the compilation of the text still predates Muhammad, recognize that a text can compile traditions that existed for centuries beforehand.

                                13 "Haran died in the presence of Teraḥ his father in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans" (Genesis 11:28). <br> <br>

                                "Haran died during the lifetime of Teraḥ his father" - Rabbi Ḥiyya grandson of Rav Ada of Yafo: Teraḥ was an idol worshipper [and a seller of idols]. One time, he went away to some place, and he installed Abraham as salesman in his stead. A person would come seeking to buy. He [Abraham] would say to him: 'How old are you?' He would say to him: 'Fifty or sixty years old.' He would say to him: 'Woe to this man who is sixty years old and seeks to prostrate himself before something that is one day old.' He would be ashamed and leave. One time, a certain woman came, carrying a dish of fine flour in her hand. She said to him: 'Here, offer it before them.' He arose, took a club in his hand, shattered all the idols, and placed the club in the hand of the largest among them. When his father came, he said to him: 'Who did this to them?' He said to him: 'I will not lie to you, a certain woman came, carrying a dish of fine flour in her hand. She said to me: Here, offer it before them. I offered it before them. This one [idol] said: I shall eat first, and another one said: I shall eat first. This big idol, who was standing among them, got up and took the club and shattered them.' He [Teraḥ] said to him: 'What, are you mocking me? Are they sentient at all?' He said to him: 'Do your ears not hear what your mouth is saying?' <br> <br>
                                
                                He [Teraḥ] took him and handed him over to Nimrod. He [Nimrod] said to him [Abraham]: 'Let us bow down to fire.' Abraham said to him: 'Let us better bow down to water, that extinguishes fire.' Nimrod said to him: '[All right,] let us bow down to water.' He said to him: 'If so, let us bow down to the clouds, that bear the water.' He said to him: '[All right,] let us bow down to the clouds.' He said to him: 'If so, let us bow down to the wind, that scatters the clouds.' He said to him: '[All right,] let us bow down to the wind.' He said to him: 'Better let us bow down to a person, who can withstand the wind.' He said to him: 'You are saying mere words. I bow down only to fire. I will cast you into it, and let that God to whom you bow down come and rescue you from it.' Haran was there and he was conflicted. He said: 'Either way [I will know what to do]; If Abraham is victorious, I will say: I am with Abraham, and if Nimrod is victorious, I will say: I am with Nimrod.' When Abraham descended into the fiery furnace and was rescued, they said to him [Haran]: 'With whom are you?' He said to them: 'I am with Abraham.' They took him and cast him into the fire and his innards were scorched. He emerged and died in the presence of Teraḥ his father. That is what is written: "Haran died in the presence of Teraḥ…"

                                13 "He said to him: I am the Lord who took you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to inherit it" (Genesis 15:7). <br> <br>
                                
                                "He said to him: I am the Lord who took you out of Ur of the Chaldeans…" - Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov and the Rabbis, Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov said: Mikhael descended and rescued him from the fiery furnace. The Rabbis said: The Holy One blessed be He Himself rescued him. That is what is written: "I am the Lord who took you out of the furnace of the Chaldeans." When did Mikhael descend [to save someone from a fiery furnace]? It was with Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya.

                            The above commentary parallels the account in the Quran in an undeniable way. The Quran, which was compiled hundreds of years after these Jewish traditions, accepted them as authoritative.

                            Critically, note that no one is asserting that a 100% copy-paste took place. Rather, we are pointing out the obvious borrowing from the Jewish tradition. Muhammad did the same thing from the Gospels, and the Torah itself, and we see him blunder many details, while clearly borrowing others.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Muhammad was unable to distinguish Midrash from Scripture, and in this case, Midrash that is known to have stemmed from an Aramaic mistranslation of Genesis 15:7. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Not only was this entire Jewish tradition based on a mistake, but it was a mistake that was never part of any Biblical text, instead being part of Rabbinic commentary. Yet, it is preserved in the Quran, because Muhammad did not have a an accurate concept of what was considered canonical Scripture by the Jews and the Christians, instead blending many different categories of source material when constructing Islam.<!-- Muhammad's source criticism consisted of "whatever stories common in 7th century Arabia that he believes".-->
