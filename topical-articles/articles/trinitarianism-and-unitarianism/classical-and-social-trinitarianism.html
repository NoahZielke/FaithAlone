                        <p class="article-body">
                            Trinity theories can be broadly categorized into two groups:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Classical - Those who distinguish between the Persons via the concept of Eternal Processions</li>
                            <li>Social - Those who distinguish between the Persons via Eternal Functional Subordination</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The above is an (over-)simplification of a topic which demands a lot of nuance to even begin to approach in a comprehensive or systematic way. See <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/" target="_blank">this entry</a> in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for a detailed breakdown of the various competing Trinity theories, which uses the terms "One-self" (Classical) or "Three-self" (Social) to refer to the broad categories discussed here.

                        <h3>A Unitarian Perspective</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            From a Unitarian perspective, the main issue with the common forms of each theory is as follows:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Classical Trinitarianism - The Son and the Spirit have an "origin" or "source" or "cause", namely, the Father, who begets/spirates them eternally and necessarily. This means that only the Father exists <i>a se</i>, that is, from Himself. However, this implies that the Son and Spirit are lesser than the Father, as they lack Aseity</li>
                            <li>Social Trinitarianism - The three Persons are described as having their own wills, their own centers of consciousness, and are not differentiated by relations of origin, but rather by the fact that the Son eternally submits to the Father, and the Spirit eternally submits to the Father and the Son. However, this seems to be indistinguishable in any meaningful way from Tritheism</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            These types of critiques have long been put forth by Unitarians, as well as Trinitarians of the opposing views. What follows is a Unitarian pointing this dilemma out as far back as 1833:

                                But in regard to all such accounts of the doctrine, it is an obvious remark, that the existence of the Son, and of the Spirit, is either necessary, or it is not. If their existence be necessary, we have then three beings necessarily existing, each possessing divine attributes; and consequently we have three Gods. If it be not necessary, but dependent on the will of the Father, then we say, that the distance is infinite between underived and independent existence, and derived and dependent; between the supremacy of God, the Father, and the subordination of beings who exist only through his will.

                                Despite protests to the contrary, social trinitarianism has all the ingredients for tritheism. For where there are three wills there are three separate centers of consciousness, and where there are three separate centers of consciousness there are three separate gods. In this view, God no longer acts as one because he is one (inseparable operations), but he acts as one because the three wills of the three persons merely cooperate with one another.

                                Part and parcel with <i>eternal functional subordination</i> is a social trinitarianism wherein we seemingly have three subjects, not one in the Divine <i>Monarxia</i>. I note a social trinitarianism inherent to the EFS position precisely at the point that we can ostensibly think that the Son could somehow be eternally obedient to the Father in a 'subordinate' manner. This reeks with the notion that there is a rupture between the Father and the Son (and thus by extrapolation, the Holy Spirit) such that the Son's being is distinct from the Father's; just at the point that it's conceivable that the Son could in any way be subordinate to the Father in the eternal reality. What we have then, if this is the case is a tri-theism; <i>viz.</i> the idea that there are three distinct centers of consciousness within the Godhead.

                                This trinitarian concept of the divine Persons as three independent subjects (which owes much to Hegel) does away with any notion of the divine unity as numerical in favor of an organic unity that results from "the coworkings of the three divine subjects" (Moltmann). Clearly, this is a social model of the Trinity, which unavoidably runs the risk of tritheism. Father, Son, and Spirit are three "non-interchangeable subjects" whose unity is rooted, not in an identity of substance, but in a common history.

Even if this eternal procession takes place necessarily and apart from the Father's will, the Son is less than the Father because the Father alone exists <i>a se</i>, whereas the Son exists through another (<i>ab alio</i>).

                                The only conclusion that one can fairly draw from this data is that Scripture provides little to no clear warrant for the speculation that the Nicene Fathers made the bedrock for the distinguishing properties of the Father and the Son. In fact, when they taught that the Father is the "source" (<i>archē</i>, or <i>fons</i>), "fountain" (<i>pēgē</i>) and "root" (<i>rhiza</i>) of the Son and that the Son in turn is God out of (<i>ek</i>) God, that is, he was begotten out of the being of the Father by a <i>continuing</i> act of begetting on the Father's part, they were, while not intending to do so, virtually denying to the Son the attribute of <i>self-existence</i>, an attribute essential to deity. There were exceptions among the Fathers, such as Cyril and the later Augustine, who did not teach so.

                                Tuggy: So Eternal generation and procession, you know, arguably they're very Central to "small c catholic" Christian theologies, but nowadays a lot of informed scholars think that these claims have no support in scripture, and sometimes they're also rejected because they imply that the Son and the Spirit lack the Divine attribute called Aseity. Do you agree with these two objections about no support in scripture - I think you just said you did agree with that - and what about the one that it implies basically ontological subordination for two of the three Persons? <br><br>
                                
                                Hollingsworth: I do tend to agree with these, and the move you typically see amongst contemporary philosophers and theologians is that they'll try to say something like this: Aseity is an attribute of Divine Essence. It's not a notional property. So while the father is ingenerate, it's acceptable that the Son is generate - that the personhood of the Son does not have Aseity, but the Son is still a se in the fact that it just has the Divine Essence. But I find this to be a very difficult claim because again on this classical view, the Persons are numerically identical to the Divine Essence. So it just doesn't make any sense to me to say well, the Father who is numerically identical to the Essence is ingenerate, the Son who's numerically identical to the Divine Essence is generate, is caused, so the Father in His personhood has Aseity, the Son in His Person lacks Aseity, so the Son somehow is a se in his Essence but not a se in His Person - but I don't know how to make sense of that if the Person is identical to the Divine Essence. That just seems like a clear contradiction to me.

They would say hey look, we just define that Divinity does not include Aseity - that's crazy Aryan stuff, we don't like that - and so we're just telling you that Divinity doesn't include Aseity. So, therefore, there's no problem with one Being passing on Divinity to another, and therefore existing because of the first. Why not that answer? <br><br>
                                
                                Hollingsworth: I guess because I think Aseity is just a pretty clear - even though it's not called "a se" - I think it's a clear Biblical teaching, that God is a necessary (Being), that God has always existed, and I think it's also including the idea of being a perfect Being. If God is a necessary Being, I don't see how He could be any other way but a se.

                            In conclusion, both of the major groupings of Trinity theories have primary disqualifying issues, which are picked up on in critiques by other Trinitarians who hold the alternative views. Attempts to defend against these critiques can get complicated rather quickly, which is demonstrative of one of the main arguments for Unitarianism, namely, that if this were something that God intended for us to believe, it would be explained in the text of Scripture by one of His prophets.

                                Jürgen Moltmann on the social Trinity <br>
                                In The Trinity and the Kingdom of God (1980), Jürgen Moltmann attempts to liberate the Christian doctrine of God from the confines both of the ancient Greek metaphysics of substance and of the modern metaphysics of transcendental subjectivity. As we shall see presently, a similar task had been undertaken a few years earlier by Eberhard Jüngel. However, Moltmann's Trinity and the Kingdom of God is of particular importance on account of its fully social doctrine of the Trinity. Moltmann's social doctrine of the Trinity emphasizes the relative independence of the person and work of the Holy Spirit in its community with the Father and the Son. Developing this in a way that might cause anxiety to some, Moltmann emphasizes that there is no fixed order in the Trinity. The unity of God is the unity of persons in relationship, as expressed in the Cappadocian doctrine of perichoresis. On this reading of the concept, Moltmann argues that "the trinitarian persons form their own unity by themselves in the circulation of the divine life." This conception of God is radically opposed, Moltmann insists, to any "monotheistic" or "monarchical" doctrine of God which would reduce the real subjectivity of the three persons. Of particular interest is Moltmann's use of this notion to develop a fundamentally theological understanding of human society. <br><br>

                                "The trinity is our social program." For Jürgen Moltmann, the doctrine of the Trinity is to be understood to provide a vision of God as a union of three divine persons or distinct, but related subjects. This specific understanding of God as a mutually loving, interacting, and sustaining society allows Christian theology to develop a theory of society. "The social doctrine of the Trinity is in a position to overcome both monotheism in the concept of God and individualism in the doctrine of man, and to develop a social personalism and personalist socialism." For Moltmann, the Christian concept of the Trinity provides "the exemplar of true human community, first in the church and also in society." Excessively authoritarian and centralized notions of government rest upon a conception of God which stresses God's "monarchy," rather than a trinitarian doctrine of God, which stresses the divine unity and community. Moltmann therefore sees the social view of the Trinity as having both a theological and a social function: theologically, it offers a penetrating critique of a false idea of God; socially, it articulates a notion of God as a social being, capable of functioning as a proper paradigm for society as a whole.
