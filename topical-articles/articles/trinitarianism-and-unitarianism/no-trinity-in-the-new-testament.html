                                The question, however, is this. It is claimed that the doctrine of the Trinity is a very important, crucial, and even basic doctrine. If that is indeed the case, should it not be somewhere more clearly, directly, and explicitly stated in the Bible? If this is the doctrine that especially constitutes Christianity's uniqueness, as over against unitarian monotheism on the one hand, and polytheism on the other hand, how can it be only implied in the biblical revelation? In response to the complaint that a number of portions of the Bible are ambiguous or unclear, we often hear a statement something like, 'It is the peripheral matters that are hazy or on which there seem to be conflicting biblical materials. The core beliefs are clearly and unequivocally revealed.' This argument would appear to fail us with respect to the doctrine of the Trinity, however. For here is a seemingly crucial matter where the Scriptures do not speak loudly and clearly. <br><br>
                                
                                Little direct response can be made to this charge. It is unlikely that any text of Scripture can be shown to teach the doctrine of the Trinity in a clear, direct, and unmistakable fashion.

                                There is a reasonable parallel to be drawn here with the evolution of the doctrine of the Trinity. No responsible New Testament scholar would claim that the doctrine of the Trinity was taught by Jesus, or preached by the earliest Christians, or consciously held by any writer in the New Testament. It was in fact slowly worked out in the course of the first few centuries in an attempt to give an intelligible doctrine of God.

                                It seems to me, although I shall not argue it here, that even if you regard the New Testament as an infallible source of doctrine, you could not derive from it a doctrine of the Trinity. Although there are many passages in the New Testament which speak of Christ as divine, and other passages which speak of the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of Christ, and of the Comforter, there are non-Trinitarian ways of interpreting the latter passages, which are just as plausible as interpreting them as expressing a doctrine of the Trinity. <br><br>

                                In other words, it seemed to me you can get two divine Persons out of the text of the New Testament, but not three. I am not going to argue that today, but I think quite a number of New Testament scholars would probably agree. So, unless Christians today recognize some good a priori argument for this doctrine - and that's going to be fairly few Christians today - I don't think anyone would be justified in believing it, unless they believe that the very fact that the Church had interpreted these passages in a Trinitarian way was strong reason for believing that doctrine.

                                Evidently this doctrine is reached by a process of thought; it is a work of reflection, rather than of direct revelation. If we hold that the doctrine of the Triunity is a revealed truth, we must admit that it is a truth that has been revealed through Christian thought partly outside the New Testament.

                                Thus, in the New Testament itself is begun the work of grounding in the nature of God those manifestations which make up the Trinity; for the accepted truth concerning Christ is already traced back to this deeper foundation. The New Testament begins the work, but does not finish it; for it contains no similar teaching with regard to the Holy Spirit. The unique nature and mission of Christ are traced to a ground in the being of God; but similar ground for the divineness of the Spirit is nowhere shown.

                                This second unfolding of doctrine came, but the writings that we possess in the New Testament were too early to record it. Even the first unfolding was only begun in the apostolic age, and occupies but little space in the New Testament. It is in the latest of the great books, the Fourth Gospel, that it is carried furthest. The second could not possibly come at once. Even the doctrine of Christ in relation to the Godhead had still to be developed, and much more the doctrine of the Spirit. God works everything in its season, and centuries passed, as they had to pass, before the relation of the Spirit to the Godhead came clearly into sight, and a definite doctrine of essential Triunity in God was established.

In other words, no theology of the trinity of persons in God had been developed by the time the canonical collection of Scriptures was closed.
