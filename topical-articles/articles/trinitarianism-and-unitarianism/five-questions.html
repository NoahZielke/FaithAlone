                            <li>When the Bible says, "There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus" (1 Timothy 2:5), how is that to be understood? Typically, Trinitarians will say that Jesus's "human nature" intercedes for mankind with God, and that is how this is to be understood. However, in Trinitarian theology, Jesus also has a divine nature, and that divine nature is the same as God the Father's, and one with Him (that is to say, not a separate instance of the divine nature, which would be a separate God, but the exact same instance that the Father has as well). So, is the human nature of Jesus interceding with His own divine nature? How can He be described as a "mediator", when there is one Person (the Son), both performing the mediation, and receiving it as well? If God is ultimately mediating with Himself, why is it called "mediation"? </li>
                            <li>When Jesus said, in reference to His second coming, "But of that day and that hour knows no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father" (Mark 13:32), did Jesus actually know the day and the hour? If He did, why did He give no warning that He was using "know" in reference to Himself in a completely different way than for the men and angels who did genuinely not have that knowledge? If He did not, then how can He be "fully God"? Being "fully God" includes having the consciousness, power, and knowledge of God, otherwise, these attributes are all separated from what it means to be "God". So, if Jesus is the same Being as the Father, and the same God as the Father, how can the Father know something that He does not? </li>
                            <li>When Jesus said, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth" (Matthew 28:18), is this to be understood as, "My human nature has just received all power and authority from my divine nature, although my divine nature already had it even before now, and throughout my entire ministry"?</li>
                            <li>When Jesus said, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire" (Matthew 26:39), was Jesus's prayer expressing a genuine desire, with the expectation that it was possible that God would answer the prayer? If not - that is, if He knew the Father's will (and the future) absolutely, and that the answer would be no - why did He pray? How can Jesus, if He has the divine mind and will, and is a single Being with the Father and Spirit, pray such a prayer? Was He praying this "in His human nature", while entirely aware in His divine nature that the Person of the Father would not desire to answer His petition? <!-- Why would Jesus need to pray at all, if He were God? Trinitarians will often respond, "If God became man, He wouldn't be an Atheist". He wouldn't be an Atheist, because He would know that He exists, but it definitely seems that He wouldn't need to pray, if He has the divine mind. Are there two minds, the one praying to the other, while being one Person? In any case, if Jesus is God, then He can be certainly be said to be praying to Himself, as only one God exists. --></li>
                            <li>When the Bible says of Jesus, "God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name" (Philippians 2:9), is this to be understood as, "Jesus's already-exalted divine nature has highly exalted His human nature, and given Himself a name which is above every name, which He already had in His divine nature"? When the Bible similarly describes Him as, "having become so much better than the angels, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they have" (Hebrews 1:4), is this to be understood as, "He became so much better than the angels in His human nature, as he inherited (in that nature) a more excellent name than they have, from His divine nature, which already had the glory and honor of the name essentially, requiring no inheritance"?</li>
