                                The simple, indeed, (I will not call them unwise and unlearned,) <b>who always constitute the majority of believers,</b> are startled at the dispensation (of the Three in One), on the ground that their very rule of faith withdraws them from the world's plurality of gods to the one only true God; not understanding that, although He is the one only God, He must yet be believed in with His own <i>oikonomia</i>. The numerical order and distribution of the Trinity they assume to be a division of the Unity; whereas the Unity which derives the Trinity out of its own self is so far from being destroyed, that it is actually supported by it. <b>They are constantly throwing out against us that we are preachers of two gods and three gods, while they take to themselves pre-eminently the credit of being worshippers of the One God;</b> just as if the Unity itself with irrational deductions did not produce heresy, and the Trinity rationally considered constitute the truth.

                                Bear always in mind that this is the rule of faith which I profess; by it I testify that the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit are inseparable from each other, and so will you know in what sense this is said. Now, observe, my assertion is that the Father is one, and the Son one, and the Spirit one, and that They are distinct from Each Other. This statement is taken in a wrong sense by every uneducated as well as every perversely disposed person, as if it predicated a diversity, in such a sense as to imply a separation among the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit. I am, moreover, obliged to say this, when (extolling the Monarchy at the expense of the Economy) they contend for the identity of the Father and Son and Spirit, that it is not by way of diversity that the Son differs from the Father, but by distribution: it is not by division that He is different, but by distinction; because the Father is not the same as the Son, since they differ one from the other in the mode of their being. <b>For the Father is the entire substance, but the Son is a derivation and portion of the whole, as He Himself acknowledges: "My Father is greater than I." In the Psalm His inferiority is described as being "a little lower than the angels." Thus the Father is distinct from the Son, being greater than the Son,</b> inasmuch as He who begets is one, and He who is begotten is another; He, too, who sends is one, and He who is sent is another; and He, again, who makes is one, and He through whom the thing is made is another. <br><br>
                                
                                Happily the Lord Himself employs this expression of the person of the Paraclete, so as to signify not a division or severance, but a disposition (of mutual relations in the Godhead); for He says, "I will pray the Father, and He shall send you another Comforter. ... even the Spirit of truth," thus making the Paraclete distinct from Himself, even as we say that the Son is also distinct from the Father; so that He showed a third degree in the Paraclete, as we believe the second degree is in the Son, by reason of the order observed in the Economy. Besides, does not the very fact that they have the distinct names of Father and Son amount to a declaration that they are distinct in personality? For, of course, all things will be what their names represent them to be; and what they are and ever will be, that will they be called; and the distinction indicated by the names does not at all admit of any confusion, because there is none in the things which they designate. "Yes is yes, and no is no; for what is more than these, comes of evil."

                                1.6 But he was recognized by the Christians in Rome, and once again incurred the same censure there; for he was charged by those who knew him for his learning with being a very learned man who had lost his grip on the truth. <br><br>
                                
                                1.7 But as a lame excuse for himself, if you please, he invented the new doctrine that follows. He said, "I didn't deny God, I denied man." Then, when they asked him, "Which man?" he answered, "I denied the man Christ." <br><br>
                                
                                1.8 Thereafter he, and the Theodotians whose founder he was, taught this doctrine of theirs and said that Christ is a mere man be gotten of a man's seed. <br><br>
                                
                                1.9 Next, as a weak defense for himself, he collected whatever texts he found useful—not that he honestly thought [this was what they meant], but he amassed them as an excuse for his defection. He said, [for example], "Christ said, 'But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth.' You see," he said, "that Christ is a man." <br><br>

                                3.1 And again this same Theodotus says, "The Law too said of him, 'The Lord will raise up unto you a prophet of your brethren, like unto me; hearken to him.' But Moses was a man. Therefore the Christ whom God raised up was this individual, but [still] a man. For he was descended from them, just as Moses was a man."

And even although we are oppressed in the world, we have confidence in Him who said, In the world you shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world. And it is He whom we call Son of God— Son of that God, namely, whom, to quote the words of Celsus, we most highly reverence; and He is the Son who has been most highly exalted by the Father. <b>Grant that there may be some individuals among the multitudes of believers who are not in entire agreement with us, and who incautiously assert that the Saviour is the Most High God; however, we do not hold with them, but rather believe Him when He says, The Father who sent Me is greater than I.

I call it a most obscure sect; for although we have often contended with heretics, yet we are unable to discover from what set of opinions he has taken this passage, if indeed he has quoted it from any author, and has not rather concocted it himself, or added it as an inference of his own. For we who say that the visible world is under the government to Him who created all things, <b>do thereby declare that the Son is not mightier than the Father, but inferior to Him. And this belief we ground on the saying of Jesus Himself, The Father who sent Me is greater than I. And none of us is so insane as to affirm that the Son of man is Lord over God.</b> But when we regard the Saviour as God the Word, and Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Truth, we certainly do say that He has dominion over all things which have been subjected to Him in this capacity, but not that His dominion extends over the God and Father who is Ruler over all.

In other words, the Son is equal in divinity to the Father, which concerns their ontological status. Concerning their functional status, however, the Son submits to the Father. The Spirit, who shares equally in divinity, also submits to the Father and (perhaps) the Son.

                        Very strange. Why should there be two Persons who eternally submit, though they are ontologically identical to the one whom they are submitting

                                What then is the unity of the persons? Appealing to John of Damascus, Moltmann posits that the unity consists of the perichōrēsis (mutual indwelling) of the persons. However, as with many of his appeals to the Eastern tradition, Moltmann fails to recognize the complete solidarity of East and West regarding the unity of the Godhead in essence. Where Moltmann substitutes perichōrēsis (mutual intercommunion) for essential unity, he fails to recognize that for the Eastern as well as Western theologians perichōrēsis presupposed this unity of essence. In part, he is motivated by a concern to see the Trinity as an open society that draws creatures into its perichoretic fellowship: "The divine Trinity is so inviting and so strong that the divine life reflects itself in true human community and takes human community up into itself, 'that they may be all one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us [John 17:21].'"

                                <i>Numbers in the form of human counting thus break down and explode at the border of a theological discussion of the Trinity.</i> Some kind of counting is involved, naturally, but not one that is fully captured by counting as we know it. We count God in a way that is merely analogous to counting in the natural world. God is one in being and not in number. God is three in persons and not in number. If one tries to use counting as an absolute guide, one ends up with either an indistinct monotheism or a non-monotheistic tritheism, both of which would lack the perfection of the Triune God. We are talking about the divine life which is the life of the one and only God. Numbers are misleading. As St. Basil wrote, "God is wholly beyond number." He rightly warns against being "carried away by an ignorant arithmetic" when it comes to the Trinity. Sage advice.

                                The phrase 'Son of God' can have a wide range of meanings. Later it came to signify Jesus' full divinity as a member of a divine Trinity. But in the first century the term had no necessary overtones of divinity: it could refer to a royal figure (cf Ps 2:7), or to the nation Israel (cf Hos 11:1) or to a righteous sufferer (cf Wis 2:17). Perhaps it would be wrong to press Mark into too rigid a mould here: Jesus is a royal figure (as will be stressed particularly in ch. 15); but as Son of God he is supremely one who will suffer and die. Indeed it may be Mark's intention precisely to spell out in his story the way in which true divine sonship should be seen.

                                In a number of passages, Yahweh addresses Yahweh, not in self-deliberation, but apparently as distinct agents. Psalm 110:1 records: "The LORD says to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'" Here Yahweh addresses a figure whom David calls his "Lord" (Adonay). In this enthronement psalm, David the king pays homage to a figure who appears as "more than royal." This Lord receives authority and power greater than David's. He and Yahweh are fully at one.

                                For what makes Christianity absolutely distinct is the identity of our God. Which God we worship: that is the article of faith that stands before all others. The bedrock of our faith is nothing less than God himself, and every aspect of the gospel—creation, revelation, salvation—is only Christian insofar as it is the creation, revelation and salvation of this God, the triune God. I could believe in the death of a man called Jesus, I could believe in his bodily resurrection, I could even believe in a salvation by grace alone; but if I do not believe in this God, then, quite simply, I am not a Christian. And so, because the Christian God is triune, the Trinity is the governing center of all Christian belief, the truth that shapes and beautifies all others. The Trinity is the cockpit of all Christian thinking.

                                John wrote his gospel, he tells us, so "that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name" (Jn 20:31). But even that most basic call to believe in the Son of God is an invitation to a Trinitarian faith. Jesus is described as the Son of God. God is his Father. And he is the Christ, the one anointed with the Spirit. When you start with the Jesus of the Bible, it is a triune God that you get. The Trinity, then, is not the product of abstract speculation: when you proclaim Jesus, the Spirit-anointed Son of the Father, you proclaim the triune God.

                                The Barthian answer is that God is one person. The social trinitarians answer that God is three persons. The traditional Catholic answer is more complicated. "These trinitarians seem to want to answer the central question both ways. God comprises three persons in some full sense of 'person.' But since each of these is in fact identical with the one divine essence, or each is in fact a center of exactly the same divine consciousness, the de facto number of persons in God is finally hard to estimate."

                            The Father is everywhere in the New Testament assumed to be the one being referred to when speaking of "God" (John 8:54, 17:1-3, 20:17, Acts 2:33, 7:55-56, Romans 1:7: 1 Corinthians 1:3, 8:6: 2 Corinthians 1:2-3, Galatians 1:3-4, 4:6, Ephesians 1:2-3, 4:6, Philippians 1:2, 4:20, Colossians 1:2-3: 1 Thessalonians 1:1-3, 3:11-13: 2 Thessalonians 1:1-2: 1 Timothy 1:2: 2 Timothy 1:2, Titus 1:4, Philemon 1:3: 1 Peter 1:3: 2 John 1:3, Jude 1:1, Revelation 1:6, etc.), indicating that for the New Testament authors, these are co-referring terms. The same is not true of the Son or Spirit. These authors believe that the Father just is God, and that is why they assume it throughout their writings. <!-- John 5:43-44, 13:3, -->

                            So, the New Testament authors use the term "God" to refer to the Father more than 99% of the time. That is highly surprising, given the hypothesis that the New Testament authors were Trinitarian. One would expect a more even distribution amongst the three Persons. Their usage of the word "God" (<i>theos</i>) instead indicates that they believed that God and the Father were numerically identical. That hypothesis better fits the data, which is that everywhere in the New Testament, the Father is assumed to be the one being referred to when speaking of "God" (John 8:54, 17:1-3, 20:17, Acts 2:33, 7:55-56, Romans 1:7: 1 Corinthians 1:3, 8:6: 2 Corinthians 1:2-3, Galatians 1:3-4, 4:6, Ephesians 1:2-3, 4:6, Philippians 1:2, 4:20, Colossians 1:2-3: 1 Thessalonians 1:1-3, 3:11-13: 2 Thessalonians 1:1-2: 1 Timothy 1:2: 2 Timothy 1:2, Titus 1:4, Philemon 1:3: 1 Peter 1:3: 2 John 1:3, Jude 1:1, Revelation 1:6, etc.). For the New Testament authors, "God" and "the Father" are co-referring terms.
