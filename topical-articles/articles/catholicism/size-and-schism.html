                            Vital to the exclusivist claims of Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy are the following assertions, which both Churches make:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>They are big - easily the least meaningful reason, technically speaking, yet having hundreds of millions of people agree with you is a powerful de facto motivation for holding a position</li>
                            <li>They are united, in visible communion of fellowship and doctrine</li>
                            <li>They are ancient, in that they keep the unadulterated tradition passed down orally by the Apostles, and preserved throughout the centuries in their Church</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            However, these claims collapse under scrutiny:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Size 
                                <ul><li>Roman Catholicism claims 1.3 billion members. However, there are only 407,000 ordained priests. This means that unless every parish has nearly 3,200 attenders, there is a high percentage of Catholics who do not practice at all. Most Catholic churches would be lucky to have 10% of that number attend per week</li></ul>
                                <ul><li>Orthodoxy is in a similar position, with the Russian Orthodox Church, for instance, claiming 110 million members, yet only having 40,000 priests. This would mean average attendance should be around 2,750 people, which is not reflective of reality</li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Unity

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>What was taught and believed by Catholics 100 years ago is rejected by modern Catholicism on the issues of <a href="../catholicism/altar-girls.html" target="_blank">female altar servers</a>, <a href="../catholicism/communion-under-both-kinds.html" target="_blank">communion under both kinds</a>, <a href="../catholicism/the-death-penalty.html" target="_blank">the death penalty</a>, and so on. What the Popes and Councils of the late Middle Ages taught in regard to the Crusades, <a href="../catholicism/torturing-heretics-and-the-inquisition.html" target="_blank">the treatment of heretics</a>, <a href="../catholicism/bible-reading.html" target="_blank">and Bible reading by laypeople</a>, looks like an almost entirely different religion. If "unity in doctrine" only means "unified right now", that is rather meaningless. There is no meaningful unity without continuity, according to an infallible standard</li>
                                            <li>Traditionalists recognize that Pope Francis is changing the Catholic Church, and openly resist or denounce him, e.g.:
                                                <ul>

                                            <li>On October 15, 2018, the Russian Orthodox Church severed communion with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople over his granting an autocephalous status to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, stating, "From now on until the Patriarchate of Constantinople's rejection of its anti-canonical decisions, it is impossible for all the clergy of the Russian Orthodox Church to concelebrate with the clergy of the Church of Constantinople and for the laity to participate in sacraments administered in its churches." This was followed by the Russian Orthodox Church breaking communion with the Patriarch of Athens (November 2019), Alexandria (December 2019), and Cyprus (November 2020), as each recognized the independence of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine </li>

                                            <li>Eastern Orthodox churches debate over the acceptance of the Revised Julian Calendar, which fixes the date of Christmas to December 25th, and changes most other holidays and feast days as well as compared to the original Julian Calendar. The revised calendar is rejected by the Russian, Serbian, Macedonian, Georgian, and Polish Orthodox Churches, and the Patriarchate of Jerusalem. Rejection of the New Calendar is a major distinctive of traditionalist groups like the True Orthodox </li>

                                    <li>Instead of keeping the doctrine of the 1st century, the Imperialist traditions each accept things that developed much later, such as the Papacy (<a href="../catholicism/top-five-reasons-catholicism-is-false.html" target="_blank">see reason #3 here</a>), the Protoevangelium of James (<a href="../catholicism/super-virgin-birth.html" target="_blank">example 1</a>, <a href="../catholicism/mary-in-the-holy-of-holies.html" target="_blank">example 2</a>), <a href="../catholicism/constantine.html" target="_blank">the Acts of Sylvester</a>, <a href="../catholicism/assumption.html" target="_blank">and the Assumption of Mary</a>. They have not kept pure Apostolic tradition, but rather have accepted many illegitimate additions from centuries afterward</li>

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The high degree of nominalism in Imperialist Churches means that they are not nearly as big as they boast. Rather, most are born into the traditions, and do not really know or care what they teach, and often don't participate in ways mandated by each tradition. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Likewise, they are not unified in practice, or doctrine. There is a huge spectrum of diversity within either tradition, both doctrinally, and practically. The Eastern Orthodox Church is also in schism. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Finally, they have each absorbed many illegitimate traditions from centuries after the time of Jesus Christ, and doing so has led to a distortion of Biblical Christianity.
