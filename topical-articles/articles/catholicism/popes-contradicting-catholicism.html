So there is one Father, not three fathers; one Son, not three sons; one holy Spirit, not three holy spirits. And in this Trinity nothing is before or after, nothing is greater or less; but the whole three persons are co-eternal together and co-equal. So that in all things, as has been said above, the unity in Trinity and the Trinity in unity is to be worshipped. <b>Whoever, therefore, wishes to be saved, let him think thus of the Trinity.</b> <br> <br>

                                The existence of the Son from the Father is certainly eternal and without beginning, and <b>the procession of the holy Spirit from the Father and the Son</b> is eternal and without beginning. <br> <br>

To those who have not accepted the interpretation given to these testimonia by the Fathers, but, on the contrary, perceive them in a manner altogether forbidden by them, we pronounce the above recorded resolution and judgment, we cut them off from the membership of the Orthodox, and we banish them from the flock of the Church of God.

                            Therefore, because each Church regards their decisions to be infallible when universally accepted (as both of the above are), there can never be unity between the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church. The issue of the Filioque is one of many examples of them canonically cursing each other that could be cited.

But God is for everyone, and therefore, we are all God's children. "But my God is more important than yours!". Is this true?

                                1 Quite opportunely the Fifth Lateran Council [1512-1517] issued this decree: "Let any member of the clergy caught in that vice against nature, given that the wrath of God falls over the sons of perfidy, be removed from the clerical order or forced to do penance in a monastery" (chap. 4, X, V, 31). <br> <br>
                                
                                2 So that the contagion of such a grave offense may not advance with greater audacity by taking advantage of impunity, which is the greatest incitement to sin, <b>and so as to more severely punish the clerics who are guilty of this nefarious crime and who are not frightened by the death of their souls, we determine that they should be handed over to the severity of the secular authority, which enforces civil law.</b> <br> <br>
                                
                                3 Therefore, wishing to pursue with greater rigor than we have exerted since the beginning of our pontificate, we establish that any priest or member of the clergy, either secular or regular, <b>who commits such an execrable crime, by force of the present law be deprived of every clerical privilege, of every post, dignity and ecclesiastical benefice, and having been degraded by an ecclesiastical judge, let him be immediately delivered to the secular authority to be put to death,</b> as mandated by law as the fitting punishment for laymen who have sunk into this abyss.

It's not a crime. "Yes, but it's a sin". Well, yes, but let's make the distinction between sin and crime.</b> But it's also a sin to lack charity with one another, so what about that? <br> <br>

                                The condemnation of homosexuality goes a long way back. Nowadays, for example, I think that more than fifty countries have legal convictions, and of those I think that ten, more or less, have the death penalty. They don't name it directly, but they say "those who have unnatural behaviors" - they try to say it in a hidden way. But there are countries that have this force or tendency, or at least cultures that have that strong tendency. <b>I think it's unfair.</b> Here in the audience, I actually get groups of people like that. <br> <br>

                                Every man and every woman must have a window in their lives where they can pour out their hope, and where they can see the dignity of God. <b>Being homosexual is not a crime. It is a human condition.</b>

                            Above, Pope Francis is commenting on homosexual acts, not orientation, as he says that what he is referring to is "a sin", and is punished with the death penalty in around ten countries. No country punishes orientation, because such a thing is impossible to prove until the act is carried out. Likewise, the Catholic Church does not teach that homosexual urges are of themselves sinful, yet Francis says that what he is referring to is "a sin". Therefore, he is stating that homosexual behavior should not be thought of as a crime, and criminalized, even though it is a sin. He confirmed that this is what he intended in a <a href="https://outreach.faith/2023/01/pope-francis-clarifies-comments-on-homosexuality-one-must-consider-the-circumstances/" target="_blank">letter exchange with Outreach,</a> a Catholic LGBT ministry.

                            Pope Francis is correct in making the distinction between a sin and a crime - not every sin was criminally punished, under the Law of God. However, homosexuality was criminalized, and punished with death (Leviticus 20:13). This is what Pope Pius V above recommended as punishment. 
                        </p>

                            However, Pope Francis rejects the death penalty entirely, having declared it "inadequate from a moral standpoint" (Fratelli Tutti, 2020 AD). Therefore, as is obvious to everyone with eyes still open to see the truth, Pope Francis has once again contradicted not only his own Church, but also the Word of God - teaching that God's Law was "unfair" for having criminalized homosexuality.

                            Historically, the Roman Catholic Church has taught that all Jews will go to Hell, and anyone practicing the Old Testament Law, including keeping the Sabbath, will go to Hell:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Council of Florence (1445 AD)</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                It firmly believes, professes and teaches that the legal prescriptions of the old Testament or the Mosaic law, which are divided into ceremonies, holy sacrifices and sacraments, because they were instituted to signify something in the future, although they were adequate for the divine cult of that age, once our lord Jesus Christ who was signified by them had come, came to an end and the sacraments of the new Testament had their beginning. But it asserts that after the promulgation of the gospel they cannot be observed without loss of eternal salvation... <b>Therefore it denounces all who after that time observe circumcision, the sabbath and other legal prescriptions as strangers to the faith of Christ and unable to share in eternal salvation, unless they recoil at some time from these errors.</b>  <br> <br>

                                <b>It firmly believes, professes, and proclaims that those not living within the Catholic Church, not only pagans, but also Jews and heretics and schismatics cannot become participants in eternal life, but will depart "into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels"</b> (Matt. 25:41), unless before the end of life the same have been added to the flock;

                            Notice that the above specifically says that the Church "denounces all who after that time observe the sabbath", referring to the beginning of the New Covenant.

                            However, Pope Benedict XVI extolled Jews for their Sabbath keeping:

                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Pope Benedict XVI - Address to the Jewish Community (September 12, 2008 AD)</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                Dear friends, it is with great pleasure that I meet with you this evening. <b>Our meeting auspiciously coincides with the vigil of the weekly celebration of the shabbat, the day which from time immemorial has occupied a significant position in the religious and cultural life of the people of Israel. Every pious Jew sanctifies the shabbat with the reading of the Scriptures and the reciting of the Psalms.</b> Dear friends, as you know, the prayer of Jesus also was nourished by the Psalms. Regularly he went to the temple and the synagogue. There he too listened to the word on the Sabbath. There he wanted to underline the goodness with which God cares for man, even in the arrangement of time. <br> <br>

                                Does not the Talmud Yoma (85b) say: the Sabbath is offered to you, but you are not offered to the Sabbath? Christ has asked the people of the Covenant to recognize always the unprecedented greatness and love of the Creator for all humanity. Dear friends, because of that which unites us and that which separates us, we share a relationship that should be strengthened and lived. And we know that these fraternal bonds constitute a continual invitation to know and to respect one another better.
                            </p>

                            It is dishonest to dialogue with Jews fraternally, and affirm their practices on the Sabbath, when an infallible Ecumenical Council of one's own Church has specifically anathematized them all to Hell, and condemned all those who keep the Sabbath. Also, the Pope quotes from the Talmud, which his predecessor Pope Innocent IV (1195-1254 AD) demanded to be publicly burned by the King of France in the Bull Impia Judeorum Perfidia (1244 AD).
