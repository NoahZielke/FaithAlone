                            This article will examine <i>The Akathist Hymn</i>. Composed circa the 6th century, it consists of 13 stanzas of praise directed primarily toward Mary. It is sung in Eastern Orthodox churches as part of the assigned church services during Lent. It is also among the works listed in the Catholic Church's <i>Enchiridion Indulgentiarum</i>, which grants a plenary indulgence for its recitation. </li>

                            Each stanza of the hymn is broken into two sections - a <i>kontakion</i> and an <i>oikos</i>. To simplify, just the stanza number will be used in the following citations.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            The first stanza begins:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Akathist Hymn - Stanza 1</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                An archangel was sent from Heaven to say to the Theotokos: Rejoice! And beholding Thee, O Lord, taking bodily form, he was amazed and with his bodiless voice he stood crying to Her such things as these: <br><br>

                                Rejoice, Thou through whom the curse will cease!<br>
                                Rejoice, height inaccessible to human thoughts:<br>
                                Rejoice, depth undiscernible even for the eyes of angels!<br>
                                Rejoice, Thou through whom creation is renewed:<br>
                                Rejoice, Thou through whom we worship the Creator!<br>
                                Rejoice, O Bride Unwedded!<br>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            To begin, the "agent" argument should be addressed, because it inevitably arises in discussions on this topic. The praises given to Mary, such as the "thou through whom creation is renewed", and "thou through whom the curse will cease" above, are excused on the basis that they are actually praises toward Christ, and Mary is only offered them because she is the conduit through which Christ accomplished the Incarnation. Does this work?
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The answer is, no, it does not. This type of argumentation has a number of problems, which render this practice inappropriate:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Jesus Christ's work cannot truly be credited or attributed to anyone else, even in a token way, especially not on the basis that they were ultimately responsible for His Incarnation. If Mary shared in, and can be gloried for, Jesus's work because she gave birth to him, then by that same token, Phares shared in, and can be gloried for, Jesus's work, because he was responsible for Mary being born (Matthew 1:3, Luke 3:33) </li>
                            <!-- <li>This same logic terminates in the position that Abraham Lincoln's mother issued the Emancipation Proclamation, LeBron James's mother broke the NBA scoring record, and Judas Iscariot's mother betrayed the Lord. Or, is it only in Mary's case, specifically when we need to find an ad-hoc justification for why we are exalting this woman in this way? </li> -->
                            <li>This is excused under the guise of praising Christ through Mary, when really it is <i>stealing</i> praise that rightly belongs to Christ alone, and directing it to another (Isaiah 42:8, 48:11). We can praise God through Mary for the good things that <i>Mary</i> did, but given that Christ alone accomplished our redemption, praising <i>Mary</i> on account of that detracts from Christ, and robs Him of glory and attention, by defacto giving the credit for his work to someone else</li>
                            <li>Many of these praises directed toward Mary do not even meet the criteria for <i>possible</i> candidates for the "agent" defense, which makes the "agent" defense seem less and less tenable in the broader context of the work as a whole, even where it could feasibly be used, if the first two points above were not taken into account</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The last point above is exemplified in the first stanza where Mary is called the "height inaccessible to human thoughts", and the "depth undiscernible even for the eyes of angels".
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In light of such statements, which are idolatrous exaltations of a human sinner, one's reading of the rest of the text is shaped. The layman reading these hymns is given an impression, and that impression thoroughly exalts a woman, not the Lord, even if the worst and most blasphemous bits seek refuge behind that facade. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Moving on to the second stanza:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Akathist Hymn - Stanza 2</h5>

                                Rejoice, crown of His dogmas! <br>
                                Rejoice, heavenly ladder by which God came down: <br>

                                Rejoice, O Bride Unwedded!
                            </p>

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Above praises Mary as the "bridge that conveyest us from earth to Heaven". As discussed already, this will be excused on account of the Incarnation ("agent" defense). However, it exhorts people to view Mary as a means of eternal Salvation, and co-savior, who in addition to Christ, is likewise required for our entrance into Heaven. 
                        </p>
                        <!-- <p class="article-body">
                            Mary is also called "the crown of His dogmas" above, which means the pinnacle of His doctrine. This is false. Christ said that the most important commandments were "love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind", and "love thy neighbour as thyself" (Matthew 22:37-40). Later, he gave a "new commandment", to "love one another; as I have loved you" (John 13:34). Never once in His preaching does He have anything to say about viewing the exaltation of Mary, or the Incarnation, as the most important doctrine. This is the result of eisegesis to the exclusion of what Jesus actually taught.

                        <p class="article-body">

                            Above, notice the statement that Mary is "the propitiation of all the world". The Word of God says:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">1 John 2:1-2</h5>

                                1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: <br>

                        <p class="article-body">
                            This is a one-to-one, direct stealing of Jesus Christ's work and saving office, and applying it to Mary. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Further, this stanza calls her a "table bearing a wealth of forgiveness". In what sense does Mary bear forgiveness? It likewise calls her "an acceptable incense of intercession". These statements lend to her being set up as an intermediary between sinners and God - the basis for the "boldness of mortals before God", which is to say, the reason we aren't terrified to approach God, even though that too is rightly ascribed only to our High Priest Jesus Christ in Hebrews 10:19-22.

The "through whom" statements ("agent" defense candidates) are interspersed between statements designed to praise Mary herself - "firm support of faith", "radiant token of grace". This furthers a conflation of the role of Christ with that of Mary in the mind of the reader.

                            Here, there is more explicit usurpation of Christ. Mary is the "rock that doth refresh those thirsting for life", when that rock which gave water was identified as Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 10:4). Mary is the "sustenance replacing manna", when Christ said <i>He</i> was the bread of life, replacing manna (John 6:48-51).

She is called the "pillar of fire", and in the next verse, is paralleled with a "cloud", which were the forms the Lord appeared in during the wandering in the wilderness (Exodus 13:21-22, 14:19-20, 14:24, 33:9, 40:34-38, Numbers 9:15-23, 10:34, 12:5, 14:14, Deuteronomy 1:33, Nehemiah 9:12, 9:19, Psalm 78:14, 99:7, 105:39): <!-- Exodus 13:7, 23:20, 32:24, 1 Corinthians 10:1-2 -->

What does it mean for a human being like Mary to be designated the Promised Land, and how does it not imply a refuge of Salvation which can only properly describe Jesus Christ?

Mary is "thou who didst fill the nets of the fishermen", when that was a miracle that the Lord performed (Luke 5:1-9, John 21:1-6), and was symbolic of the abundance found in Him, and our total reliance on Him for all good things.

                            Here, Mary is implored to "deliver us from all misfortune, and rescue from the torment to come", that is, to save us. This is yet another egregious placing of Mary on equal grounds with the Lord, as one to look to, and rely on, for Salvation.

                            And, what is startling is the frequency with which this is done in the hymn. Recall stanza two's statement that Mary is the "bridge that conveyest us from earth to Heaven". Recall stanza three's statement that Mary is the "propitiation of all the world". Recall stanza four's statement that Mary is the one "through whom we are clothed with glory". Recall stanza seven's statements that she is our "supplication before the Righteous Judge", and the "robe of boldness for the naked". Recall stanza eight's statement that Mary is the "key to the kingdom of Christ". Recall stanza nine's statement that Mary is the "ship for those who wish to be saved". Recall stanza ten's statement that Mary "weds the faithful to the Lord". All of these things taken together leave the impression that Mary is to be, functionally, one's savior, in whom they are to place their hope for Salvation, and justification before God.

                        <!-- The following could be excused on the basis that it is an instruction for Mary to praise YHWH, however, that's a stretch, couched in the context of the rest of the hymn. Was Mary, throughout the hymn, praising the Lord with us? No. Rather, we were praising her the whole time. Nevertheless, this one survives on a technicality, so it's omitted. 
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Finally, the Salvation offered by Mary is to be obtained by crying "Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!", to <i>her</i>. Saying "Alleluia" to a human being does not make sense. It is a word of praise to God, directed to God, which uses His divine name - literally meaning "praise YHWH". Likely, the composer of this hymn was ignorant of that fact, and thought that it was a general term of praise, which is why he addresses it toward Mary. However, if properly understood, this would be a blasphemous conflation of Mary with YHWH.

                            This article could be multiplied with very many other Marian prayers, doctrinal statements, and hymns (see <a href="#appendices">the Appendices</a>). It exemplifies the absurd, and frankly blasphemous role to which Mary is exalted in Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, which could never be obtained by any fair reading of the Bible, but rather is a reflection of monastics, who had an obsession with asceticism and virginity (Colossians 2:20-23), and who lived many hundreds of years after the real person named Mary, who gave birth to Jesus Christ (before going on to have other children) was long dead and buried, elevating her to such an unbiblical position out of misplaced devotion, and departure from the model given by the Apostolic writings and other Scripture.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Another popular and authoritative Marian prayer in Roman Catholicism is the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary, also known as the Loreto Litany. This prayer, which is often incorporated into the Rosary, has had various lines added to it by Popes over the centuries, indicating, obviously, their approbation of it. It is cited positively in Pope Pius XII's encyclical Ad Caeli Reginam (1954 AD). It is also listed in the <i>Enchiridion Indulgentiarum</i>, which grants a partial indulgence for its recitation. The text used for this section is from the <a href="https://www.vatican.va/special/rosary/documents/litanie-lauretane_en.html" target="_blank">Vatican's website</a>.

                            The Marian portion of the prayer addresses Mary with a title, followed by "pray for us":

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Omitted above are dozens of other praises given to Mary in the full prayer, but the above are objectionable for the following reasons: 
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>"Morning star" - In the New Testament, when applied to a person, this term is used exclusively for Jesus Christ (2 Peter 1:19, Revelation 22:16). The term can be used of others (Job 38:7, Isaiah 14:12), but given that it is taken directly by the Lord at the climax of the Bible (Revelation 22:16), discretion would favor using it only in that Christological context <!--Notice the constant pushing of the envelope into ever higher and higher exaltation of Mary--></li>
                            <li>"Refuge of sinners" - There is absolutely no Biblical hint that Mary can be called the "refuge of sinners", in any sense. Rather, Jesus presents <i>Himself</i> as the refuge of sinners, and compels all to come to Him (Matthew 11:28). Jesus Christ, not Mary, is our advocate with the Father when we sin (1 John 2:1), and our intercessor through which we can approach God directly (1 Timothy 2:5 with Hebrews 4:15-16)</li>
                            <li>"Comfort of the afflicted" - In the New Testament, God is the one "Who comforts us in all our tribulation" (2 Corinthians 1:3-4). Also, the Apostle Peter instructs believers to "Cast all your care on Him, for He cares for you" (1 Peter 5:7), when speaking of God. Therefore, Biblically speaking, the one to whom believers are to look to for comfort in "all" their cares and afflictions is God, who is the true "Comfort of the afflicted"</li>
                            <li>"Queen conceived without original sin" - Mary was not conceived without Original Sin, even according to several of those that the Catholic Church has declared Saints and Doctors of the Church, as is covered at length in <a href="../catholicism/immaculate-conception.html" target="_blank">this article</a>. There is no Biblical indication that Mary was sinless, let alone conceived without a sinful nature, and Biblical indication directly to the contrary, as God records her making a "sin offering" for an "atonement for her" in the New Testament (Luke 2:24, Leviticus 12:6-8)</li>
                            <li>"Queen assumed to heaven" - Likewise, there is no Biblical indication at all that Mary was assumed to Heaven, and neither is there any historical indication that such an event took place, as is covered at length in <a href="../catholicism/assumption.html" target="_blank">this article</a> </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Therefore, the Loreto Litany is another example of a prayer which exalts Mary far beyond what any fair reading of the New Testament could ever possibly yield.

                            The most objectionable line above is the one in which Mary is called "our life, our sweetness, and our hope". The Vatican version begins this line with another "Hail", which unambiguously means these titles are directed toward Mary, whereas some versions which lack that "hail" may read from the previous line as though Mary is merely <i>the mother of</i> "our life, our sweetness, and our hope". If one were to only read it that way, it would not be as bad - however, the Vatican version explicitly disallows that reading, and historically, it is not the correct way to understand the prayer.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This is affirmed by Alphonsus Liguori (1696-1787 AD), a Saint and Doctor of the Church, who, commenting specifically on this prayer, says: 
                        </p>

                                In order to understand rightly the reason why the holy Church calls Mary our life, we must consider that as the soul gives life to the body, so divine grace gives life to the soul; for a soul without grace, though nominally alive, in truth is dead, as we find in the Apocalypse: "Thou hast the name of being alive, and thou art dead." As Mary, then, obtains for sinners, by her intercession, the gift of grace, she restores them to life.

                            However, Mary cannot, in any sense - even tangentially - ever be called "our life". She is not "our life" temporally, experientially, or eternally, in any sense whatsoever. Biblically, Jesus Christ "is our life" (Colossians 3:4, John 14:6), and the only thing that determines whether someone has Eternal Life is whether they believe in Him (John 3:36). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Similarly, Mary cannot be called "our hope", in any sense whatsoever. Biblically, Jesus Christ is "our hope" (1 Timothy 1:1), that is, our joyful expectation of glorification (Colossians 1:27). His resurrection from the dead is the basis for our "living hope" (1 Peter 1:3), and His Second Coming is our "blessed hope" (Titus 2:13). The Bible, therefore, exalts Jesus as "our hope", and leaves no room for calling someone like Mary "our hope". 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Another errant part of this prayer is when it portrays Mary as the one to whom we are to look to for mercy - "Turn then, thine eyes of mercy toward us" - and calls her our "advocate", whereas, as mentioned already, the Bible says our "advocate with the Father" when we sin is "Jesus Christ the righteous" (1 John 2:1).

                            Therefore, this short prayer is also heterodox, and detracts from the worship of Christ in its exaltation of Mary.

                        <h3>Appendix III - Octobri Mense</h3> <!-- No One Comes to the Father but by Mary -->
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Of note in discussions around Mary's role in official Roman Catholic teaching is the statement of Pope Leo XIII (1810-1903 AD) in his Encyclical Octobri Mense, which says: 
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Pope Leo XIII - Octobri Mense (1891 AD)</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                4 With equal truth may it be also affirmed that, by the will of God, Mary is the intermediary through whom is distributed unto us this immense treasure of mercies gathered by God, for mercy and truth were created by Jesus Christ. <b>Thus as no man goeth to the Father but by the Son, so no man goeth to Christ but by His Mother.</b> <br> <br> 

                                How great are the goodness and mercy revealed in this design of God! What a correspondence with the frailty of man! We believe in the infinite goodness of the Most High, and we rejoice in it; we believe also in His justice and we fear it. We adore the beloved Saviour, lavish of His blood and of His life; we dread the inexorable Judge. Thus do those whose actions have disturbed their consciences need an intercessor mighty in favour with God, merciful enough not to reject the cause of the desperate, merciful enough to lift up again towards hope in the divine mercy the afflicted and the broken down. <b>Mary is this glorious intermediary;</b>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Here, Mary is presented as the way of Salvation, as without her, "no man" can approach Jesus Christ. To Pope Leo XIII, Jesus is our way to the Father, but, of Jesus, he says "we believe also in His justice and we fear it", "we dread the inexorable Judge". Therefore, <i>another</i> mediator between mankind and Jesus is required - "Mary is this glorious intermediary". 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Leo mentions the need for recourse to Mary in the context of a person who has done "actions (which) have disturbed their conscience". He presents Jesus as harsh - the Judge to be feared, and avoided, in such situations. However, in direct contradiction to this, the Bible says our "advocate with the Father" when we sin is "Jesus Christ the righteous" (1 John 2:1). It does not say that Jesus is unapproachable, but rather that He is our sole basis for being able to approach God for mercy in our time of need (1 Timothy 2:5 with Hebrews 4:15-16). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Bible exalts Jesus Christ as holy, and as the judge of mankind (2 Timothy 4:1, John 5:21-22). However, for those who have been born again into the family of God by faith, and have been made members of Christ's own Body, the Bible never presents Jesus as unapproachable, or one to whom a believer can only go to, while trembling, through a more "gentle" intermediary, such as Mary. Such a concept is unknown to Biblical Christianity.

                            <i>The Glories of Mary</i> is a book on Mariology written by Alphonsus Liguori (1696-1787 AD). It is mostly a compilation of historical Marian devotions by other Saints, and teachers throughout Catholic history.

                            Lending to its authority is the status of Liguori, who is a Saint, and was declared a Doctor of the Church by Pope Pius IX (1792-1878 AD) in 1871. The edition of The Glories of Mary cited in this article has the imprimatur of Archbishop John Hughes (1797-1864 AD) of New York.

                                25 For all these reasons St. Alphonsus Ligouri, in collecting the testimony of past ages, writes these words with evident devotion: "Because the virgin Mary was raised to such a lofty dignity as to be the mother of the King of kings, it is deservedly and by every right that the Church has honored her with the title of 'Queen'."

                            This is mentioned for the sake of Catholic laymen and apologists, who, rightfully embarrassed by the contents of this book, would wish to intimate that it is not authoritative, nor representative of what Catholicism teaches about Mary. Alphonsus Liguori was an ordained priest, bishop, Saint, and Doctor of the Church.

                            Comparatively, what an unordained apologist, or Catholic laymen says, is magisterially meaningless, having no authority whatsoever to determine what Roman Catholicism teaches about anything. They are not at liberty to declare anything in this book to be heterodox, but rather, must submit to it as containing nothing heterodox according to the Church, unless they can bring the opinion of an actual authority in Catholicism to declare it so, which would only be creating contradiction within their hierarchy, given how many authorities have already approved it over the course of so many years.

                                St. Bonaventure declares that those who are devoted to publishing the glories of Mary are secure of paradise; and Richard of St. Laurence confirms this by saying that to honor the queen of angels is to acquire life everlasting, since our most grateful Lady, adds the same author, pledges herself to honor in the other life him who promises to honor her in this; and is there any one ignorant of the promise made by Mary herself to those who engage in promoting the knowledge and love of her upon the earth? 'They that explain me shall have life everlasting.'

St. Thomas confirms this in his preface to the Canonical Epistles, saying that the holy Virgin, when she conceived the divine Word in her womb and brought him forth, obtained the half of the kingdom of God by becoming queen of mercy, Jesus Christ remaining king of justice.

Richard of St. Laurence expresses the same thought, when he says: God lamented, before the birth of Mary, that there was no one to restrain him from punishing the sinner; but Mary being born, she appeases him.

Both terrified and moved in his feelings, he remembered that he himself too had wounded his Redeemer by his sins, and began to weep, <b>but he observed that the child turned away from him.</b> In deep confusion, he had recourse to the most holy Virgin, saying: <b>"Mother of mercy, thy Son rejects me; I can find no advocate more kind and more powerful than thou,</b> who art his mother; my queen, aid me, and pray to him in my behalf." The divine mother answered him from that image: "You sinners call me mother of mercy, but yet you do not cease to make me mother of misery, renewing the passion of my Son, and my dolors." But because Mary never sends away disconsolate those who cast themselves at her feet, she began to entreat her Son that he would pardon that miserable sinner. <b>Jesus continued to show himself unwilling to grant such a pardon,</b> but the holy Virgin, placing the infant in the niche, prostrated herself before him, saying: "My Son, I will not leave thy feet until thou hast pardoned this sinner."

                                This volume contains thirteen prayers to the Theotokos, together with three supplicatory canons by St Theodore the Studite, St Methodios of Constantinople, and St John of Euchaita. The prayers are taken from a group of writings attributed to the fourth-century Church Father, St Ephraim the Syrian. Popular in the Byzantine period, these writings are not in fact the work of St Ephraim, but were written in Greek by patristic and Byzantine writers, whose names for the most part have been lost or were never recorded. Today these writings are described as the work of "Ephraim graecus," or the "Greek Ephraim," to distinguish them from the authentic works of St Ephraim written in Syriac. These writings form a vast number of works that, in their most recent edition, fill seven volumes, and are second in number only to the works of St John Chrysostom. Though these writings are difficult to date, many of them were read by the learned patriarch, St Photios of Constantinople, and thus we can safely assume that at least some of the texts in the collection are at least as old as, and in some cases likely older than, the ninth century.

The supplicatory canons were written by Saint Theodore the Studite (759-826 AD), Saint Methodios I of Constantinople (788-847 AD), and Saint John of Euchaita (1000-1080 AD).

                            And, Mary is presented as the recourse for one who believes that they "dare not ask the loving God to heal my many sins and incurable wounds". This view leads them to say, "I have no other hope or refuge apart from you", to Mary. This view is unbiblical, the Bible says that "if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous" (1 John 2:1). This verse keeps coming up in this discussion, because it is a key verse in opposition to the view put forth by the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, wherein Jesus is very far, and distant, and not to be approached when one sins. Rather, one must approach God, in fear and trembling, only through the apparently more merciful Mary when they sin, which is exactly the opposite of what 1 John 2:1 teaches, and intends to impart. Jesus is our Advocate when we sin, and our robe of boldness before the throne of God to obtain mercy (Hebrews 4:14-16).

                            Notice above, also, that Mary has "the ability to bring about whatever (she wishes)". As can be seen from the other prayers, this is ostensibly through petitioning Jesus. But, Mary is portrayed as <i>functionally</i> omnipotent, throughout this book, as a result of having total control over Jesus, who honors all of her petitions, as He is "bound under obligation to honor" Mary (pg. 15).

This last praise applies Genesis 3:15, in which Jesus is prophesied to crush the head of the serpent, to Mary.

                            The first supplicatory canon is that of Saint Theodore the Studite. The format alternates between a sinner entreating Mary, Mary entreating Jesus on his behalf, Jesus's response to Mary, and Mary's response to the sinner. In it, Jesus is portrayed as distant and unmerciful, even in spite of the sinner having repented and confessed, and Mary's supplication on his behalf.

                            This concludes an overview of the Mother of the Light prayer book. The only impression that one can get after reading such a book is that Mary has functionally replaced Jesus in Eastern Orthodoxy, and is somehow closer, and more merciful than He is, as she is the all-powerful, all-merciful one to whom a person is to recourse after having angered Jesus Christ.

                            The Psalter of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Psalterium Beatae Mariae Virginis) is a work attributed to Saint Bonaventure (1221-1274 AD), who is a Doctor of the Church. It re-frames the Book of Psalms, addressing each one to Mary.

                                This work was written by St. Bonaventure. It will be found in the Vatican edition of his works. It is largely quoted in the Glories of Mary, by St. Liguori, Cardinal Wiseman's great authority. I have ten editions of it, under the title of <i>Tributo Quotidiano</i>, from 1834 to 1844, published at Rome, with the express approbation of the late Pope, Gregory XVI: and one copy of the same work, in Italian, dated 1851, during the present Pontificate, with the official Imprimatur.

                            In verse 3, the Psalm says "Come ye to her, all who labor and are in trouble: and she will give refreshment to your souls", directly contradicting the Bible, in which Jesus says, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28). The Word of God instructs one who is weary to go to Jesus Christ; this text instructs them to go to Mary. The two are not the same, and going to Mary is not the same as going to Jesus.

                                Do not let me, your unworthy servant, be lost forever; but using your maternal intercessions heal my miserable soul, which has been ruined by my evil passions, and which the enemy has broken, and crushed, and ground into the earth on account of my love of sin. This is why I am utterly filled with shame, and <b>this is why I do not dare ask, nor do I have anyone to entreat on my behalf, the loving God to heal my many sins and incurable wounds.</b> I have defiled the temple of my body, staining it grievously through my disgraceful desires. I have corrupted all my senses through unlawful and unseemly acts. I have no confidence to raise my hands to heaven, for I have defiled them with sinful deeds; nor do I have a mouth to open in prayer, for I have sullied it by mocking and judging my neighbor.

Richard of St. Laurence expresses the same thought, when he says: God lamented, before the birth of Mary, that there was no one to restrain him from punishing the sinner; but Mary being born, she appeases him.

                            In closing, it should be pointed out that Imperialists will often defend their practice of invocation of the Saints with very modest examples (motte) in comparison to what is actually practiced (bailey). The practice, they may ensure us, is just the same as one asking living believers to pray for them to God. This article has demonstrated that it goes far beyond one merely asking a departed believer to pray for them.

                            One does not call another believer "the Salvation of my soul", neither does one say to another believer, "Thou art the only advocate with Jesus Christ; to thee we all have recourse", and so on. So, the above quotations are demonstrations of the fact that Catholic and Orthodox Marian peity goes far beyond the modest form of invocation to the Saints which is often appealed to when they are attempting to justify their piety, which greatly exceeds what is Biblically appropriate.
