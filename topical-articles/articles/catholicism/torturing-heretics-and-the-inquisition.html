                        <h3>The Catholic Church's Historical Treatment of Heretics</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Roman Catholic Church's criminalization of heretics can be seen as early as the Second Lateran Council (1139 AD), which declared:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Second Lateran Council (1139 AD)</h5>

                                23 Those who, simulating a kind of religiosity, condemn the sacrament of the Lord's body and blood, the baptism of children, the priesthood and other ecclesiastical orders, and legitimate marriages, <b>we expel from the church of God and condemn as heretics, and prescribe that they be constrained by the secular powers.</b> We also bind up their defenders in the fetter of the same condemnation. 
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Notice that even in the early 12th century, the Church was working with secular governments to actively persecute those who disagreed with it on doctrinal grounds. 
                        </p>

                            The 12th century also saw the issuance of the first Papal Bull that is known to have called for the punishment of specific heretics, Ad Abolendam (1184 AD), issued by Pope Lucius III (1097-1185 AD):
                        </p>
                        <!-- https://professor-moriarty.com/info/files/resources/verona1184.txt -->

                            <h5 class="pt-2">Pope Lucius III - Ad Abolendam (1184 AD)</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                To abolish the malignity of diverse heresies, which of late time are sprung up in most parts of the world, it is but fitting that the power committed to the Church should be awakened, <b>that by the concurring assistance of the imperial strength,</b> both the insolence and impertinence of the heretics, in their false designs, may be crushed, and the truth of catholic simplicity shining forth in the holy Church, may demonstrate her pure and free from the execrableness of their false doctrines. <br> <br>

                                <b>More particularly we declare all Cathari, Paterines, and those who call themselves the Humbled, or Poor of Lyons, Passagines, Josephines, Arnoldists, to lie under a perpetual anathema:</b> and because some under a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof, as the Apostle saith, assume to themselves the authority of preaching, whereas the same Apostle saith, How shall they preach, except they be sent? <br> <br>

                                And as for a layman who shall be found guilty, either publicly or privately, of any of the aforesaid crimes, unless by abjuring his heresy, and making satisfaction, he immediately returns to the orthodox faith; <b>we decree him to be left to the sentence of the secular judge, to receive condign punishment, according to the quality of his offense.</b>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Notice the above mentions groups such as the Arnoldists, and the Waldensians ("Poor of Lyons"), and advocates for their persecution. The Waldensians would later be targeted again for extermination in Pope Innocent VIII's (1432-1492 AD) Bull Id Nostri Cordis (1487 AD). <!--and those who died in combat against them were promised a full plenary indulgence.-->Often, defenders of the Catholic Church, in attempting to excuse the violent persecution carried out by the Church, will emphasize the Church's targeting of the Albigenses, who were extremely heterodox, as if that somehow justifies their annihilation. However, it was not just Dualists being persecuted, but legitimate Proto-Protestant groups, whose beliefs fell well within what would be accepted today as Christian orthodoxy. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The above declaration would be echoed in Canon 3 of the Fourth Lateran Council:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Fourth Lateran Council (1215 AD)</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                3 We excommunicate and anathematize every heresy raising itself up against this holy, orthodox and catholic faith which we have expounded above. <b>We condemn all heretics, whatever names they may go under.</b> They have different faces indeed but their tails are tied together inasmuch as they are alike in their pride. <b>Let those condemned be handed over to the secular authorities present, or to their bailiffs, for due punishment.</b> <br> <br>

                                Let secular authorities, whatever offices they may be discharging, be advised and urged and if necessary be compelled by ecclesiastical censure, if they wish to be reputed and held to be faithful, to take publicly an oath for the defence of the faith to the effect that they will seek, in so far as they can, to expel from the lands subject to their jurisdiction all heretics designated by the church in good faith. Thus whenever anyone is promoted to spiritual or temporal authority, he shall be obliged to confirm this article with an oath. <b>If however a temporal lord, required and instructed by the church, neglects to cleanse his territory of this heretical filth, he shall be bound with the bond of excommunication by the metropolitan and other bishops of the province.</b> <br> <br>

                                <b>Catholics who take the cross and gird themselves up for the expulsion of heretics shall enjoy the same indulgence, and be strengthened by the same holy privilege, as is granted to those who go to the aid of the holy Land.</b> Moreover, we determine to subject to excommunication believers who receive, defend or support heretics. 
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Notice again that the Church worked closely with the state to ensure that heretics were punished. Also, notice that the same Indulgence promised to the Crusaders (mentioned later in the same council) will be given to those who reprimand heretics. This is significant, because in Roman Catholic theology, Indulgences are an exercise of the power of the Keys (Matthew 16:19). This means that this council is promising a God-sanctioned remission of guilt, founded upon the office of the Papacy, in exchange for persecuting heretics.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            A few years after the Fourth Lateran Council, Pope Gregory IX (1170-1241 AD) would issue Ille Hamni Generis (1232 AD), which is generally regarded as having officially started what would come to be known as the Inquisition. It, along with Licet ad Capiendos (1233 AD), appointed the Dominicans and Franciscans to organize the Inquisition in France, Italy, and Germany. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This would be followed over the subsequent centuries by many other Papal Bulls, which created or re-established the Inquisition, or crusades against heretics, in various countries, a semi-complete list being:

                            Some of these Inquisitions would go on to last for hundreds of years. The Spanish Inquisition, by far the most infamous of them all, was enabled by the issuing of Exigit Sinceræ Devotionis (1478 AD) by Pope Sixtus IV (1414-1484 AD), and would last until 1834 AD - over 350 years.  
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            One of the above, Ad Extirpanda (1252 AD), given by Pope Innocent IV (1195-1254 AD), again demonstrated how the Church worked with the state to criminalize those that it deemed to be heretics:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Pope Innocent IV - Ad Extirpanda (1252 AD)</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                2 At the commencement of his term of office... <b>the head of state or ruler of the city or feudal domain shall accuse of criminal conduct all heretics</b> of both sexes, no matter by what name they appear on the rolls of citizens. And he will confirm his right to the office inherited from his predecessor in this manner. And furthermore, that <b>no heretical man or woman may dwell, sojourn, or maintain a bare subsistence in the country,</b> or any kind of jurisdiction or district belonging to it, whoever shall find the heretical man or woman shall boldly seize, with impunity, all his or their goods, and freely carry them off, to belong to the remover with full right, unless this kind of removing is restricted to persons designated by law.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            The blame for the Inquisitions cannot be offloaded onto the secular authorities, because the Church demanded that they criminalize heretics, and of course, the Church was the one giving the state their definition of "heresy" in the first place. Biblically, this implicates them directly, as if they themselves were doing the killing (2 Samuel 12:9).
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            And, because the Church claimed authority over temporal rulers, handing over those who they knew would be executed for heresy is "(the sword being) exercised on behalf of the Church":

                                We are informed by the texts of the gospels that in this Church and in its power are two swords; namely, the spiritual and the temporal. For when the Apostles say: 'Behold, here are two swords' (Luke 22:38), that is to say, in the Church, since the Apostles were speaking, the Lord did not reply that there were too many, but sufficient. Certainly the one who denies that the temporal sword is in the power of Peter has not listened well to the word of the Lord commanding: 'Put up thy sword into thy scabbard' (Matthew 26:52). <b>Therefore, both are in the power of the Church, namely, the spiritual sword and the material. But indeed, the latter is to be exercised on behalf of the Church; and truly, the former is to be exercised by the Church. The former is of the priest; the latter is by the hand of kings and soldiers, but at the will and sufferance of the priest.</b>

                            The "exegesis" above is not only a ridiculous twisting of Scripture, but also directly implicates the Church in all the atrocities done to heretics on whom it passed sentence, even if those atrocities were carried out by secular authorities in Roman Catholic church-states, "at the will and sufferance of the priest". <!-- It is historically certain that there was an understanding from the secular authorities in Roman Catholic nations that they themselves would face ecclesial censure if they did not punish heretics that were remanded to them by the Church. -->

On this matter of faith and morals, the Bible tells us to "mark and avoid" heretics (Romans 16:17), not criminalize them, torture them, and then remand them to the authorities for punishment.

                            One notable heretic who was killed in the midst of all of this was the Proto-Protestant Jan Hus (1369-1415 AD), who was burned at the stake in 1415 AD after being condemned by the Council of Constance (1414-1418 AD). The burning of Jan Hus, and others like him, was defended during the time of Martin Luther, in Pope Leo X's (1475-1521 AD) list of errors:

                            Taking all of the above into account, it is apparent that the Catholic Church actively and brutally persecuted those who disagreed with it on matters of doctrine, and that the fate of those deemed heretics by the Roman Catholic Church was often horrific.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            The declarations of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965 AD) changed a lot in the Roman Catholic Church. It changed so much, so clearly, that some traditionalist Catholics formed Sedevacantist groups, which declare the Council heretical, and accuse all subsequent Popes of being Antipopes which have abandoned the Catholic faith. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This change extended to the matter in question, namely, how the Church is to deal with heretics, and the subject of religious liberty more broadly. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            One of its declarations is entitled Dignitatus Humanae - Declaration on Religious Freedom. In it, we read:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Vatican 2 (1965 AD) - Dignitatus Humanae</h5>

                                2 <b>This Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom.</b> This freedom means that <b>all men are to be immune from coercion</b> on the part of individuals or of social groups and of any human power, in such wise that <b>no one is to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his own beliefs, whether privately or publicly,</b> whether alone or in association with others, within due limits. <br> <br>
                                
                                <b>The council further declares that the right to religious freedom has its foundation in the very dignity of the human person as this dignity is known through the revealed word of God and by reason itself.</b> This right of the human person to religious freedom is to be recognized in the constitutional law whereby society is governed and thus it is to become a civil right.

                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The above, in light of Catholic history covered in the preceding section, is an inarguable <i>contradiction</i>, because it is declaring that "the right to religious freedom" has its basis in the dignity of mankind itself, and "is known through the revealed word of God and by reason itself". Likewise, "all men are to be immune from coercion" in religious matters. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Yet, the same Church has historically, and infallibly, taught that people must be "coerced" (tortured, besieged in crusades, persecuted) for holding beliefs that it deemed to be heretical. These are clear, irreconcilable, <i>contradictions</i>. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The entire declaration is consistent and explicit in establishing the principles of freedom of conscience in religious matters, and the right to religious freedom: 
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Vatican 2 (1965 AD) - Dignitatus Humanae</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                3 Wherefore every man has the duty, and therefore the right, to seek the truth in matters religious in order that he may with prudence form for himself right and true judgments of conscience, under use of all suitable means. On his part, man perceives and acknowledges the imperatives of the divine law through the mediation of conscience. In all his activity a man is bound to follow his conscience in order that he may come to God, the end and purpose of life. <b>It follows that he is not to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his conscience. Nor, on the other hand, is he to be restrained from acting in accordance with his conscience, especially in matters religious.</b> <br><br>

                                <b>Injury therefore is done to the human person and to the very order established by God for human life, if the free exercise of religion is denied in society,</b> provided just public order is observed. <br> <br>

                                6 It follows that a wrong is done when government imposes upon its people, by <b>force or fear or other means, the profession or repudiation of any religion,</b> or when it hinders men from joining or leaving a religious community. <b>All the more is it a violation of the will of God and of the sacred rights of the person and the family of nations when force is brought to bear in any way in order to destroy or repress religion,</b> either in the whole of mankind or in a particular country or in a definite community. 
                                <br> <br>

                                10 It is one of the major tenets of Catholic doctrine that man's response to God in faith must be free: no one therefore is to be forced to embrace the Christian faith against his own will. <b>This doctrine is contained in the word of God and it was constantly proclaimed by the Fathers of the Church.</b>

                            The above statements declare the actions of former Popes and councils to have done "injury... to the human person, and to the very order established by God for human life", to have acted in "violation of the will of God and of the sacred rights of the person", and to have acted in ways "foreign to the mind of Christ". As is obvious, this is in direct contradiction to historic Catholic doctrine, taught and implemented for many hundreds of years, and ordered by many "Vicars of Jesus Christ", along with Ecumenical Councils.

                            Also, in establishing the principle of freedom of conscience in religious matters, it further directly contradicts Pope Pius IX's (1792-1878 AD) famous Syllabus of Errors:

                                77 In the present day it is no longer expedient that the Catholic religion should be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other forms of worship. <b><i>(Condemned)</i></b> <br>

                                79 Moreover, it is false that the civil liberty of every form of worship, and the full power, given to all, of overtly and publicly manifesting any opinions whatsoever and thoughts, conduce more easily to corrupt the morals and minds of the people, and to propagate the pest of indifferentism. <b><i>(Condemned)</i></b>

                            Above, Pope Pius IX condemns exactly the kind of religious liberty that Vatican 2 established as a fundamental human right, given by God. And, as the final section above shows, this was an Ex Cathedra statement.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Historically, the Catholic Church infallibly taught that the persecution, torture, and execution of those who disagreed with it on doctrinal matters was Biblically proper, and claimed authority over the secular rulers who carried out executions on heretics. The same Church, in modern times, infallibly teaches that religious freedom is a God-given human right, and decries any attempt to suppress religious freedom. All the while, it maintains that it has never erred on matters of faith and morals.

                            These claims are meaningless, and indisputably false. The Catholic Church has simply contradicted itself, as is obvious to anyone having their eyes still open to the truth. Diving into Church history reveals case after case of such contradiction, and this one in particular resulted in such an incredible amount of suffering.

Wherefore as Porphyry, that enemy of piety, for having composed licentious treatises against religion, found a suitable recompense, and such as thenceforth branded him with infamy, overwhelming him with deserved reproach, his impious writings also having been destroyed; so now it seems fit both that Arius and such as hold his sentiments should be denominated Porphyrians, that they may take their appellation from those whose conduct they have imitated. <br><br>

Let him also suffer the penalty of these laws.

For the law declares that anyone convicted in such a matter is to be punished with capital punishment.
                                
                                Farewell in the Lord. May God keep you, beloved brothers.

                            Latin 1:
                                Victor Constantine, the great and pious, to the bishops and through them to the regions and peoples.
                                The malevolent and ungodly Arius, imitating the devil, justly deserves to bear the same infamy as him.
                                For just as Porphyry, an enemy of piety, composed books against religion and received a fitting recompense for such impiety, so that in later times writings worthy of reproach might be found, filled with much disgrace and the corruption of his ungodly works—thus it has now pleased (us) that Arius and his followers be called 'Porphyrians,' so that those whose ways have imitated his may also bear his name.

                                If anywhere a treatise or writing composed by Arius is found, it must be consigned to the fire, so that not only the depravity of his doctrine may be destroyed, but also that no memory of him may remain.

                                However, I warn this: if anyone is found to have hidden books composed by Arius and does not immediately bring them forth and burn them with fire, the penalty for that person shall be death. For whoever is discovered in possession of such a book shall undergo the punishment appropriate to such a crime.

                                The end.

                            Latin 2:
                                Emperor Constantine Augustus to the bishops and the people:

                                Arius, who has imitated the wicked and impious, is justly deserving of the same disgrace as they. Just as Porphyry, the enemy of divine worship, composed some new and godless works attacking religion and received a fitting reward for his merits, so that for all time he should be held in reproach, like one who sought glory through wickedness, and whose decrees, most impious, pleased the most wicked — so now it has pleased (us) that Arius and those who share his plans be called 'Porphyrians,' so that those whose conduct imitates theirs may also be called by their name and be associated in word as well as in guilt.

                                To this, however, we add that if any writings composed by Arius are found, they must be delivered to be burned, so that not only the wicked things which belong to his doctrine may be destroyed, but also that no commentary of his may be left.

                                But above all, we proclaim this: that if anyone is found to possess a little book composed by Arius, or to have concealed one and does not immediately hand it over to be burned, the only penalty for him shall be death. For one who is immediately exposed or convicted shall be subject to capital judgment.

                                The end.

                                It is our desire that all the various nations which are subject to our Clemency and Moderation, should continue to profess that religion which was delivered to the Romans by the divine Apostle Peter, as it has been preserved by faithful tradition, and which is now professed by the Pontiff Damasus and by Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, a man of apostolic holiness. According to the apostolic teaching and the doctrine of the Gospel, let us believe in the one deity of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, in equal majesty and in a holy Trinity. <b>We order the followers of this law to embrace the name of Catholic Christians; but as for the others, since, in our judgment they are foolish madmen, we decree that they shall be branded with the ignominious name of heretics, and shall not presume to give to their conventicles the name of churches. They will suffer in the first place the chastisement of the divine condemnation and in the second the punishment of our authority which in accordance with the will of Heaven we shall decide to inflict.</b>

                                Moreover, he who is an adherent of the Nicene Faith, and a true believer in the Catholic religion, should be understood to be one who believes that Almighty God and Christ, the Son of God, are one person, God of God, Light of Light; and let no one, by rejection, dishonor the Holy Spirit, whom we expect, and have received from the Supreme Parent of all things, in whom the sentiment of a pure and undefiled faith flourishes, as well as the belief in the undivided substance of a Holy Trinity, which true believers indicate by the Greek word <i>ousia</i>. These things, indeed, do not require further proof, and should be respected. <br><br>

                                Let those who do not accept these doctrines cease to apply the name of true religion to their fraudulent belief; and let them be branded with their open crimes, and, having been removed from the threshold of all churches, be utterly excluded from them, as We forbid all heretics to hold unlawful assemblies within cities. If, however, any seditious outbreak should be attempted, We order them to be driven outside the walls of the City, with relentless violence, and We direct that all Catholic churches, throughout the entire world, shall be placed under the control of the orthodox bishops who have embraced the Nicene Creed.
