                            This article uses the term "super-virgin birth" to represent the manner in which Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy go above ("super") the Biblical doctrine that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, and teach that Mary remained physically a virgin, even after giving birth to Jesus.

                                We believe the Son of God, Jesus Christ, to have emptied Himself, that is, to have taken into His own Person human flesh, being conceived of the Holy Spirit, in the womb of the ever-virgin Mary; and, becoming man, to have been born, without causing any pain or labor to His own Mother after the flesh, <b>or injury to her virginity,</b> to have suffered, to have been buried, to have risen again in glory on the third day, according to the Scriptures, to have ascended into the heavens, and to be seated at the right hand of God the Father. Whom also we look for to judge the living and the dead.

                                57 This union of the Mother with the Son in the work of salvation is made manifest from the time of Christ's virginal conception up to His death it is shown first of all when Mary, arising in haste to go to visit Elizabeth, is greeted by her as blessed because of her belief in the promise of salvation and the precursor leaped with joy in the womb of his mother. This union is manifest also at the birth of Our Lord, <b>who did not diminish His mother's virginal integrity but sanctified it,</b> when the Mother of God joyfully showed her firstborn Son to the shepherds and Magi.

                                499 The deepening of faith in the virginal motherhood led the Church to confess Mary's real and perpetual virginity <b>even in the act of giving birth</b> to the Son of God made man. In fact, Christ's birth "did not diminish his mother's virginal integrity but sanctified it." And so the liturgy of the Church celebrates Mary as Aeiparthenos, the "Ever-virgin".

                            Therefore, incredibly, simply being able to believe that Mary gave birth to Jesus in a normal way, where He passed through her birth canal as a child normally does, requires one to be Protestant. Both major Imperialist traditions do not allow one to believe that Jesus was born of Mary in a normal manner, instead asserting that a miracle took place that is not mentioned or implied anywhere in the text of Scripture. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Both traditions have elevated Mary to such unbiblical heights (see extensive documentation <a href="../catholicism/akathist-hymn.html" target="_blank">here</a>), that they have proceeded to go beyond even a legitimate miracle God performed with Mary - the virgin birth - and in essence assert that she did not actually give birth to Jesus. A baby cannot be born of a woman without breaking her maidenhead, which is what this doctrine specifically denies. So, Jesus's body could not have passed through her birth canal. Instead, somehow, God phased the body of the Lord through it. This is unknown to Scripture, which when mentioning Jesus's birth, never indicates anything of the sort taking place (Matthew 1:25, Luke 2:7, Galatians 4:4).

                        <h3>Biblical Argumentation</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Biblical argumentation given for this doctrine is based on Isaiah 66:7:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Isaiah 66:6-13</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                6 A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies. <br>
                                7 Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child. <br>
                                8 Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children. <br>
                                9 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God. <br>
                                10 Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her: <br>
                                11 That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory. <br>
                                12 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees. <br>
                                13 As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
                            </p>

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Verse 7 says "before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child". This restatement of the same thing after a pause, in slightly different wording, is extremely common in poetic sections of the Bible, and this is saying that a birth took place extremely quickly. The "she" in the passage refers to "Zion" ("Jerusalem"), bringing forth "children", <i>plural</i>, and a "nation" (verse 8). Verse 8's mention of Zion's "travail" means that verse 7 uses hyperbole to convey the idea of a very rapid birth that is so fast, it is as if there is no time for labor pains.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            So, there is "travail", <i>"children"</i>, plural, and also what's being spoken of is Jerusalem, which Mary is never paralleled with anywhere in Scripture, and in light of verse 12 especially, refers to the city, or nation of Israel as a whole, and not a single person. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Further, in Roman Catholic thinking, this painless birth was due to Mary not inheriting Original Sin, and therefore avoiding the curse on Eve in Genesis 3:16 - "in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children". However, a woman's maidenhead breaking had absolutely nothing to do with the curse in the Garden of Eden, as all women before the fall still would have given birth through their birth canal, which would have broken their maidenhead if it were somehow still intact after conceiving. This doctrine goes <i>beyond</i> a woman merely giving birth without labor pains, which is the type of "pain" specifically being spoken of in Isaiah 66:7. But, even granting that this passage applies to Mary (which it does not), and meant that Mary had no pain anywhere in her body whatsoever when giving birth to Jesus (which is not what it refers to), God could easily have made Mary's maidenhead breaking painless. This passage, even if all concessions are granted, does not get one to a super-virgin birth. <!--The passage is in reference to <i>labor pains</i>, not that the woman would have been exempt from a toothache she may have had, or had no feeling of anything in her birth canal (God could still have a painless maidenhead breaking if He desired)-->
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Finally, recognize that due to the dearth of Biblical support for the Marian obsession displayed by Catholicism and Orthodoxy, it seems that any verse mentioning a woman giving birth can be applied to Mary, even if context disallows it. Here, in Isaiah 66:7, the woman allegedly has no travail. In Revelation 12:1-2, there is a woman "travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered", yet this too is endlessly applied to Mary in Catholicism (Pope Pius X, Ad Diem Illum Laetissimum 24, Pope Pius XII, Munificentissimus Deus 27, etc.). Although neither passage in context can refer to Mary, and the woman in one passage allegedly has no travail, while the other has travail, still it is asserted that both passages apply to Mary, because context does not actually matter so long as Mary can be exalted by the application of the passage to her. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Extrabiblical Sources of the Doctrine</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Protoevangelium of James is considered the primary source of this doctrine, which later generations would attempt to read back into Scripture, as discussed above. This text, which is also responsible for <a href="../catholicism/mary-in-the-holy-of-holies.html" target="_blank">Eastern Orthodoxy's doctrine that Mary lived in the Holy of Holies</a>, is known to be early, as Origen (185-253 AD) refers to a version of it (Origen, Commentary on Matthew, Book 10, Chapter 17). <!-- https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/101610.htm -->

                            In the text, Salome does not believe that Mary has given birth as a virgin, and, being made to plagiarize - or rather, blasphemously parody - doubting Thomas (John 20:25-27), says that she will not believe unless she examines Mary herself:

                                19 It is Mary that was reared in the temple of the Lord, and I obtained her by lot as my wife. And yet she is not my wife, but has conceived of the Holy Spirit. And the midwife said to him: Is this true? And Joseph said to her: Come and see. And the midwife went away with him. And they stood in the place of the cave, and behold a luminous cloud overshadowed the cave. And the midwife said: My soul has been magnified this day, because my eyes have seen strange things - because salvation has been brought forth to Israel. And immediately the cloud disappeared out of the cave, and a great light shone in the cave, so that the eyes could not bear it. And in a little that light gradually decreased, until the infant appeared, and went and took the breast from His mother Mary. And the midwife cried out, and said: This is a great day to me, because I have seen this strange sight. <br> <br>

                                And the midwife went forth out of the cave, and Salome met her. And she said to her: Salome, Salome, I have a strange sight to relate to you: a virgin has brought forth - a thing which her nature admits not of. Then said Salome: As the Lord my God lives, unless I thrust in my finger, and search the parts, I will not believe that a virgin has brought forth. <br> <br>

                                20 And the midwife went in, and said to Mary: Show yourself; for no small controversy has arisen about you. And Salome put in her finger, and cried out, and said: Woe is me for mine iniquity and mine unbelief, because I have tempted the living God; and, behold, my hand is dropping off as if burned with fire.

                                14 And many said: "She has not borne a child, nor has a midwife gone up (to her), nor have we heard the cries of (labour) pains." And they were all blinded respecting Him and they all knew regarding Him, though they knew not whence He was.

                            To note a few things on these two sources:

                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>The accounts entirely contradict one another. The Protoevangelium of James says that Jesus appeared from a flash of light, in a cave, in Bethlehem, with midwives present. The Ascension of Isaiah says that Jesus appeared outside of Mary instantly, in Joseph's house, in Bethlehem, when Mary and Joseph were alone. The teaching that Joseph had a house in Bethlehem also makes nonsense of Luke 2:7</li>
                            <li>The Protoevangelium of James is pseudepigraphal, childish fiction. It portrays a miraculous birth of Mary, who is then received as a child at the Second Temple in Jerusalem by virgins of Israel and the Temple's priest, and dances as a three year-old on the third step of the Temple's altar (Chapter 7). She then lives, as discussed in the <a href="../catholicism/mary-in-the-holy-of-holies.html" target="_blank">aforementioned article</a>, <i>inside</i> the Holy of Holies, being fed by angels from Heaven, for her entire childhood (Chapter 8, 13, 15). This is a text designed at base to exalt Mary, by inventing fictional and impossible narratives of her life </li>
                            <li>The Ascension of Isaiah is likewise a mockery of a forgery, claiming that Isaiah was shown all of these events, and even the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ, in a vision, and then told them to King Hezekiah. Yet, in a particularly Gnostic twist, for some reason, "Isaiah made (Hezekiah) swear that he would not tell (it) to the people of Israel, nor give these words to any man to transcribe" (Ascension of Isaiah <!--break-->11:39)</li>

                            Finally, the Odes of Solomon, a text dated to first or second century AD, contains a passage that alludes to a painless birth of the Messiah, couched within some truly bizarre statements:

                                1 A cup of milk was offered to me, and I drank it in the sweetness of the Lord's kindness. <br>
                                2 The Son is the cup, and the Father is He who was milked; and the Holy Spirit is She who milked Him; <br>
                                3 Because His breasts were full, and it was undesirable that His milk should be ineffectually released. <br>
                                4 The Holy Spirit opened Her bosom, and mixed the milk of the two breasts of the Father. <br>
                                5 Then She gave the mixture to the generation without their knowing, and those who have received it are in the perfection of the right hand. <br>
                                6 The womb of the Virgin took it, and she received conception and gave birth. <br>
                                7 So the Virgin became a mother with great mercies. <br>
                                8 And she labored and bore the Son but without pain, because it did not occur without purpose. <br>
                                9 And she did not require a midwife, because He caused her to give life. <br>
                                10 She brought forth like a strong man with desire, and she bore according to the manifestation, and she acquired according to the Great Power. <br>
                                11 And she loved with redemption, and guarded with kindness, and declared with grandeur. Hallelujah.

                            The above is a strange, potentially heterodox description of the Father being "milked" by the Holy Spirit, who is described with the feminine pronouns "She" and "Her". <!-- Verse 10, in another translation, says of Mary that "she brought forth, as if she were a man, of her own will", which makes it seem as if she had direct agency over when she gave birth, making it odd that she would have chosen to have done so in a crowded Bethlehem while her and Joseph were without accommodation, and away from home. -->Yet, because this doctrine has no Scriptural warrant at all, texts like the above are all that proponents of it have to work from. Of course, they employ <a href="../islam/apocryphal-jesus.html" target="_blank">the same tactics that Muslims employ</a> when attempting to defend the pseudepigraphal narratives that found their way into the Quran, by saying that these documents, though heretical, represent a genuine tradition in the parts which they need to affirm. This ad-hoc excuse is unfalsifiable, and can be used to justify believing literally anything from any forged document in history.

                            And, to reiterate, even if one were to grant that Mary had an <i>entirely painless</i> birth, there is no reason to believe that Mary's maidenhead remained intact, as God could have made her maidenhead breaking painless, just as He would have made everything else associated with the birth that typically causes pain painless as well. A mere statement that the birth was painless, as in the Odes of Solomon, does not count as evidence. One would need something like in the Protoevangelium of James, or the Ascension of Isaiah, wherein Mary did not actually give birth to Jesus through her birth canal, in order to support the super-virgin birth.

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The unbiblical doctrine of the super-virgin birth appears to have stemmed from forged, heterodox writings which were designed to exalt Mary, and defend her virginity from Jewish and Pagan polemics, composed long after the ones in whose names they were writing had already passed away. Yet, it is a doctrine bound infallibly on the conscience of Christians by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches.

                        <!-- These texts seem to have been forged in defense of Mary's virginity from Jewish and Pagan polemics -->
