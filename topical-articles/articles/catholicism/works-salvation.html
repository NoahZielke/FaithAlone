                        <p class="article-body">
                            To begin, recognize that there is seldom a professing Christian who has ever lived that would say that a person can get to Heaven 100% without Jesus Christ, solely on the basis of their own works, by way of self-justification. It is rare that someone is so foolish. So, this is not what anyone is stating when accusing someone, as this article does, of preaching a works-based Salvation message. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Instead, nearly everyone who teaches a works-based Salvation will pay varying levels of lip service to grace, and faith, and mercy, and the payment of Jesus Christ. Would anyone deny that the Judaizers, whom the Apostles warned about (Acts 15:24), would have extolled the grace and mercy of God, and the virtue of faith? Of course they did - those themes permeate the Old Testament, which they claimed to identify with rigorously. But it was <i>adding</i> the fact - as Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox do - that mankind is justified, at least in part, by the works that they perform, that drew the Anathema of God (Galatians 1:8-9). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            So, that is what this article aims to demonstrate - that both Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy teach that part of a reason a person goes to Heaven is based on how they live their lives, and those works that they perform ultimately contribute to their justification before God. <i>This</i> is what we mean by "works Salvation"; not some bare Pelagianism that excludes grace entirely. The issue is not the necessity of grace - all acknowledge that. The issue is the <i>sufficiency</i> of grace. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Roman Catholicism</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Council of Trent (1545-1563 AD) has many canons rejecting Salvation and justification by faith alone. However, more specifically, they also spell out that the works that one performs are actually the cause of the increase of their justification before God:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Council of Trent (1563 AD) - Canon 24 on Justification </h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                24 If any one saith, that the justice received is not preserved <b>and also increased before God through good works;</b> but that the said works are merely the fruits and signs of Justification obtained, <b>but not a cause of the increase thereof;</b> let him be anathema. 
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The above states two times that "good works" are the cause of the "increase" of one's justification before God. It also specifically denies that good works are "merely the fruits and signs of Justification obtained". 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Further, Trent also explicitly stated that good works are not merely the gift of God, but rather are additionally the "good merits of him that is justified":
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Council of Trent (1563 AD) - Canon 32 on Justification </h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                32 If any one saith, <b>that the good works of one that is justified are in such manner the gifts of God, as that they are not also the good merits of him that is justified;</b> or, that the said justified, by the good works which he performs through the grace of God and the merit of Jesus Christ, whose living member he is, <b>does not truly merit increase of grace, eternal life, and the attainment of that eternal life,</b> - if so be, however, that he depart in grace, - and also an increase of glory; let him be anathema. 
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The above, in keeping with Canon 24, also states that those good works "truly merit increase of grace, eternal life, and the attainment of that eternal life". That is, they are a basis for one's standing before God as it pertains to getting to Heaven. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Therefore, the Roman Catholic Church teaches, that God enables one to do works, and those works are really theirs, and they actually are the cause of the increase of one's justification before God, and "merit" for them "the increase of eternal life, and the attainment of that Eternal Life". Those works are not merely the results of one's completed justification, nor can they be entirely called a gift of God. They depend on the individual, and that individual's Salvation depends on their choosing to perform them, and ultimately, they cause one to "merit" Eternal Life.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Therefore, one's basis for getting to Heaven in Roman Catholicism can be stated to be, without any slander or misrepresentation, the fact that they performed many good works, in cooperation with God.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Eastern Orthodoxy</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Eastern Orthodoxy, also, at the universally-accepted Synod of Jerusalem (1672 AD), explicitly rejected Salvation by faith alone, and imputed righteousness, and taught that good works are not merely signs of Salvation, but the means by which faith becomes efficacious for the person:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Synod of Jerusalem (1672 AD) - Decree 13</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                We believe a man to be not simply justified through faith alone, but through faith which works through love, that is to say, through faith and works. <b>But the idea that faith can fulfill the function of a hand that lays hold on the righteousness which is in Christ, and can then apply it unto us for salvation, we know to be far from all Orthodoxy.</b> For faith so understood would be possible in all, and so none could miss salvation, which is obviously false. <br><br>
                                
                                But on the contrary, we rather believe that it is not the correlative of faith, but the faith which is in us, justifies through works, with Christ. <b>But we regard works not as witnesses certifying our calling, but as being fruits in themselves, through which faith becomes efficacious,</b> and as in themselves meriting, through the Divine promises that each of the faithful may receive what is done through his own body, whether it be good or bad.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The above rejects the idea that one simply "lays hold on the righteousness which is in Christ" by faith. Rather, they must perform works, in cooperation with Christ. If they do not, they will not be justified before God, as one cannot be justified before God by the merits of Christ only, if they do not perform works in accordance with their faith - with the help of Christ, of course. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Therefore, the message is in accordance with that of Roman Catholicism - one's Salvation hangs in the balance, depending on the individual's performance of good works, which actually justify them before God. Whether or not one gets to Heaven depends in part on these works. 
                        </p>

                            <p class="mb-1">
                                39 What is over-great confidence in the grace of God? <br><br>

                                Those likewise partake of this error who expect to obtain eternal life by faith only without good works.

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In Catholicism and Orthodoxy, how one behaves after believing in Jesus determines whether they go to Heaven or Hell, and their performance of good deeds are seen as actually securing their justification, and forming a basis as to why God lets them into Heaven after death.
