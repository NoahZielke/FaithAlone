                        <h3>Cyril Lucaris</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Cyril Lucaris (1572-1638 AD) was the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople at various points between 1612-1638 AD. His published letters, as well as a confession of faith published under his name, demonstrate that he was a Calvinist, who completely rejected the Orthodox faith as it is professed by the current Orthodox Church.

                                13 We believe that man is justified by faith and not by works. But when we say by faith, we understand the correlative or object of faith, which is the righteousness of Christ, which, as if by hand, faith apprehends and applies unto us for our salvation. This we say without any prejudice to good works, for truth itself teaches us that works must not be neglected, that they are necessary means to testify to our faith and confirm our calling. But that works are sufficient for our salvation, that they can enable one to appear before the tribunal of Christ and that of their own merit they can confer salvation, human frailty witnesses to be false; but the righteousness of Christ being applied to the penitent, alone justifies and saves the faithful.

                                13 We believe a man to be not simply justified through faith alone, but through faith which works through love, that is to say, through faith and works. But [the idea] that faith can fulfill the function of a hand that lays hold on the righteousness which is in Christ, and can then apply it unto us for salvation, we know to be far from all Orthodoxy. For faith so understood would be possible in all, and so none could miss salvation, which is obviously false. But on the contrary, we rather believe that it is not the correlative of faith, but the faith which is in us, justifies through works, with Christ. But we regard works not as witnesses certifying our calling, but as being fruits in themselves, through which faith becomes efficacious, and as in themselves meriting, through the Divine promises {cf. 2 Corinthians 5:10} that each of the Faithful may receive what is done through his own body, whether it be good or bad.

                            This confession, and the controversy that it caused, was the impetus for the Synod of Jerusalem (1672 AD), which is universally binding on all Orthodox Christians, having been accepted by all Patriarchates.

                            The Synod attempted to address and refute the Confession of Cyril, point-by-point. However, it denied that Cyril himself authored the confession, which is historically untenable, as is documented at length in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/_yQBY2lPWUc?si=88_jw9oDlyglOe5D" target="_blank">Cyril Lucaris: Calvinist Patriarch/Orthodox Saint</a>, by AncientPathsTV. There is an extant signed copy of the confession by Cyril, and his letters likewise demonstrate that his beliefs aligned with those in the confession, and that he was active in disseminating those beliefs to those he ministered to.

                            However, despite denying that Cyril authored the confession, the Synod of Jerusalem declared that, regardless, Cyril was a "a wretch", "having no part with Christ":

                            The Eastern Orthodox Church attempted to rewrite history at the Synod of Jerusalem, claiming that Cyril was not a Calvinist. The <a href="https://youtu.be/_yQBY2lPWUc?si=88_jw9oDlyglOe5D" target="_blank">aforementioned documentary</a>, which inspired this article, demonstrates that this is a plain attempt at historical revisionism by the Synod - a Synod which is held by Orthodox Christians to have been guided by the Holy Spirit, and infallible.

                            Additionally, the modern Eastern Orthodox Church contradicts itself, by canonizing a person who was explicitly declared to be an impious, unsaintly individual by the Synod of Jerusalem.
