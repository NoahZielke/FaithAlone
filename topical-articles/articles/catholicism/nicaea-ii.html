                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Second Council of Nicaea (787 AD) is regarded by Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians as the 7th Ecumenical Council, meaning that they affirm it to be infallible in matters of doctrine. It was a response to the Iconoclast controversy, which surrounded the permissibility of creating and venerating religious images. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            It overturned the earlier Council of Hieria (754 AD), which had also declared itself the 7th Ecumenical Council, and forbade the use of icons and images in worship:

                            The above council was summoned by the Iconoclast Byzantine emperor Constantine V (718-775 AD). However, this council would only stand for a few decades, as after Constantine V died, the empress Irene of Athens (750-806 AD), who was sympathetic to icons, convoked the Second Council of Nicaea. This same empress Irene would later gouge out the eyes of her own son, Constantine VI, and then imprison him until he died, in order to become sole ruler of the Byzantine empire.

                            This council made image veneration into a <i>sine qua non</i> of Salvation. It did not merely decree that image veneration was permissible, but rather was an essential part of orthodoxy, without which someone was to be cut off from the Body of Christ:

                                If anyone does not salute such representations as standing for the Lord and his saints, let him be anathema. <br><br>

                                Let them who do not venerate the holy and venerable images be anathema! <br>
                                To those who have a doubtful mind and do not confess with their whole hearts that they venerate the sacred images, anathema! <br> <br>

                                We salute the venerable images. We place under anathema those who do not do this. <br><br>

                                [We have likewise decreed] that these images are to be reverenced (προσκυνεῖν), that is, salutations are to be offered to them. The reason for using the word is, that it has a two-fold signification. For κυνεῖν in the old Greek tongue signifies both "to salute" and "to kiss". And the preposition προς gives to it the additional idea of strong desire towards the subject; as for example, we have φέρω and προσφέρω, κυρῶ and προσκυρῶ, and so also we have κυνέω and προσκυνέω. Which last word implies salutation and strong love; for that which one loves he also reverences (προσκυνεῖ) and what he reverences that he greatly loves, as the everyday custom, which we observe towards those we love, bears witness, and in which both ideas are practically illustrated when two friends meet together. <br> <br>

                                If anyone does not accept this our Holy and Ecumenical Seventh Synod, let him be anathema from the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, and from the seven holy Ecumenical Synods! <br><br>

                                Now anathema is nothing less than complete separation from God. For if any are quarrelsome and will not obediently accept what has now been decreed, they but kick against the pricks, and injure their own souls in their fighting against Christ.

                            <li>"Salute" is explicitly defined in the council as "strong desire towards the subject", and "salutation and strong love" is implicated. That is, they are mandating a feeling of real love when venerating images, on pain of Hell</li>

                            The Second Council of Nicaea, therefore, added to the Gospel venerating of pieces of wood and stone, which have been painted to look like Biblical figures. Without engaging in this practice, one cannot be saved.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Often, the discussion around images will get bogged down in the distinction, or lack thereof, between worship and veneration. Such a discussion is just a distraction. The real issue is that they have made the veneration of images a requirement for Salvation, which is a flagrant assault on the Gospel. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Gospel message is clearly elucidated in Scripture (1 Corinthians 15:1-8), it is defined as God's message of Salvation (Romans 1:16: 1 Corinthians 1:17-18, Ephesians 1:12-14: 2 Timothy 1:10), it is carefully guarded against <i>any</i> attempt to add <i>anything</i> at all to it (Acts 15:5-11: 2 Corinthians 11:3-4, Galatians 1:6-9, 2:11-14), and it does not include venerating icons. The Second Council of Nicaea violently overthrew the Bible's testimony of the Gospel, and replaced it with another Gospel, which included something expressly forbidden in both Testaments. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Second Council of Nicaea also notes that "incense and lights may be offered according to ancient pious custom" to images. Burning incense and candles to an image differs from physical acts of veneration (such as kissing, bowing, or prostrating), crossing over into actions that would not even be done to a human being in any legitimate context, even if that person were actually present, and one wanted to show them respect. <!-- Study regarding incense: https://ontheruinofbritain.wordpress.com/2019/08/22/opposition-to-incense-in-the-early-church-fathers-and-anglicanism/ -->
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Finally, the Council states that "the honour which is paid to the image passes on to that which the image represents". However, this cannot be true in the case of images of Jesus Christ, specifically, for Catholics and Orthodox who profess to believe that Jesus is God. Otherwise, why are they not to worship an image of Christ as if it were God itself? Does the veneration given to an image of Christ become amplified into true and proper worship somehow? Where is such a mechanism described in Scripture?

                        <h3>A Biblical Analysis of Icon Veneration</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Beginning with the Biblical case against icon veneration, it should be noted that three times in the New Testament, veneration is <i>rejected</i> by a saint (Peter, Acts 10:25-26), as well as an angel (Revelation 19:10, 22:8-9) - both of which are subjects of Catholic and Orthodox iconography. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Firstly, notice Peter's response to Cornelius's veneration in Acts chapter 10:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Acts 10:25-26</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. <br>
                                26 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            There is no indication that Cornelius, "A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house" (Acts 10:2), either thought that Peter was God, or wanted to worship him as God. Instead, he was venerating Peter, and Peter denies it, saying "I myself also am a man". In saying this, Peter is teaching that even the Apostles or prophets were not legitimate subjects of such veneration. If veneration of the actual human being Peter was denied, how much <i>more</i> should the veneration of a piece of wood or metal painted to look like Peter be denied. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Secondly, twice in the vision that the Apostle John receives in the book of Revelation, he errantly worships an angel:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Revelation 19:10</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Revelation 22:8-9</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                8 And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things. <br>
                                9 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            As in the case of Cornelius, there is no indication that the Apostle John thought that this angel was God, or was worshipping the angel as God. Instead, he honors the angel by bowing before it, and twice, the angel denies the veneration, saying "I am thy fellowservant". The angel also states, as part of his denial, that he is "of thy brethren the prophets", which would seem to extend this denial of veneration to prophets more generally. He concludes his denial of John's veneration with an instruction to "worship God". 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In addition to these New Testament examples, the Bible is filled with verses which, in context, prohibit the kind of image veneration done by Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Venerative iconography forbidden on the basis that it has no life, which is true of all Catholic and Orthodox iconography - Deuteronomy 4:14-28, Psalm 115:4-8, 135:15-18, Isaiah 44:9, Jeremiah 10:14-15, 51:17-18, Habakkuk 2:18-19</li>
                            <li>Other - Colossians 2:18, Acts 17:29-30, Exodus 20:4-6, 34:14, Deuteronomy 5:8-10, 16:22, 27:15, Judges 17:1-6</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Those who would desire to defend the veneration of icons from the Bible often point to the bronze serpent that Moses was instructed to make in the wilderness when the people sinned (Numbers 21:5-9), the cherubim that were on the Ark of the Covenant (Exodus 25:18-22), and the various Temple decorations (1 Kings 6:23-35: 2 Chronicles 3:7-14, etc.).
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In response:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>The Bronze Serpent - Unlike Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox iconography, Israelites did not regularly venerate the bronze serpent, as part of worship of the Lord, nor were they told to venerate it. They were told to "look upon it", when Moses held it up, and those who "beheld it" were healed, on one occasion. Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians do not merely look at their icons - they adore them, kiss them, light candles before them, and burn incense to them. Later, when people began to burn incense to the bronze serpent, King Hezekiah destroyed it (2 Kings 18:3-4)</li>
                            <li>The Cherubim on the Ark - Similarly, unlike Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox iconography, God never told the Israelites to venerate the cherubim on the Ark of the Covenant as part of regular worship of Himself. They do not kiss them, adore them, burn incense to them, or light candles to them. The Ark was kept out of sight of all the people, in the Holy of Holies of the Temple/Tabernacle (Exodus 26:33-34), and it was only seen by the High Priest once per year on the Day of Atonement (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus%2016&version=KJV" target="_blank">Leviticus 16</a>, Hebrews 9:3-7)</li>
                            <li>The Temple decorations - Once again, absent is any instruction to venerate the Temple decorations as part of the worship of the Lord. King Solomon also cast statues of oxen (1 Kings 7:23-25: 2 Chronicles 4:2-4), and carvings of lions and oxen, alongside the carvings of cherubim (1 Kings 7:29, 7:36). This does not mean that the Israelites were to venerate oxen and lions, nor any of the other Temple decorations. And, the engravings being appealed to by those in favor of icons are once again of cherubim. The religion of the Old Testament was not one of cherubim veneration or mediation

                            Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox cannot find a normative use of religious imagery in the Bible to support the normative manner in which they use images. Instead, they often attempt to appeal to <i>events,</i> <i>never</i> commandments by God, in which He establishes any sort of regular veneration of religious icons as part of worship of Himself, because He never does so, and so they cannot. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Lastly, it is worth noting that closely related to image veneration is the practice of praying to the Saints for intercession. With regard to this practice, the silence in Scripture is deafening. Abraham, Moses, and David had long been dead by the time of the New Testament, yet none of the Apostles pray to these most significant figures to seek their intercession. Likewise, John the Baptist and Stephen had already been martyred (and their bodies were <i>buried</i>, not partitioned up for relics - Matthew 14:10-12, Mark 6:24-29, Acts 8:2), yet God recorded none praying to them for intercession. When Jesus teaches us how to pray, He tells us to pray to the Father (Matthew 6:9, Luke 11:2). There are no instances of prayers to deceased people in Scripture, nor does God ever tell believers to engage in such a practice. And, this cannot be dismissed as an <i>invalid</i> argument from silence, as we are given hundreds of <i>positive</i> examples of prayer in the Bible, and all of these prayers are directed to God or Jesus.

                            The argument from Church history against image veneration is overwhelming. It is impossible to view what exists of early Christian writings, and maintain that the Byzantine iconodulia that was mandated by the Second Council of Nicaea was a universal and Apostolic practice.

                            Beginning historical citations against icon veneration is Origen (185-253 AD), a prolific Christian writer based in Alexandria. While Origen is widely known for his opposition to the use of images, the following quotation is particularly interesting because it is drawn from <i>The Philocalia of Origen</i> - a collection of his writings compiled by two influential early Christian theologians, Basil of Caesarea (330-379 AD), and Gregory of Nazianzus (329-390 AD):

                                3 For though the perverted doctrine, backed up with much instruction, has been able to implant in the minds of the many the belief that images are gods, and that things made of gold, and silver, and ivory, and stone, are worthy of worship; <b>common sense, nevertheless, forbids us to think that God is by any means corruptible matter, or that He is honoured when He is fashioned by men in forms of dead matter, supposed to pictorially or symbolically represent Him.</b>

Also, in context, the statement is never qualified in such a way that would suggest that Christians, while not doing whatever Origen is condemning here, nevertheless have their own <i>proper</i> images of God, or any other holy individual.

His sole surviving work, <i>Octavius</i>, is a dialogue between a Pagan named Caecilius and a Christian named Octavius. In it, Caecilius asks why Christians have "no acknowledged images", and Octavius responds:

Now what kind of thing is this that you call the image of Christ? I do not know what impelled you to request that an image of Our Saviour should be delineated. What sort of image of Christ are you seeking? Is it the true and unalterable one which bears His essential characteristics, or the one which He took up for our sake when He assumed the form of a servant?... Granted, He has two forms, even I do not think that your request has to do with His divine form.... Surely then, you are seeking His image as a servant, that of the flesh which He put on for our sake. But that, too, we have been taught, was mingled with the glory of His divinity so that the mortal part was swallowed up by Life. Indeed, it is not surprising that after His ascent to heaven He should have appeared as such, when, while He - the God, Logos - was yet living among men, He changed the form of the servant, and indicating in advance to a chosen band of His disciples the aspect of His Kingdom, He showed on the mount that nature which surpasses the human one - when His face shone like the sun and His garments like light. <br> <br>

If, therefore, His incarnate form possessed such power at the time, altered as it was by the divinity dwelling within Him, what need I say of the time when He put off mortality and washed off corruption, when He changed the form of the servant into the glory of the Lord God. . . ? … How can one paint an image of so wondrous and unattainable a form—if the term 'form' is at all applicable to the divine and spiritual essence - unless, like the unbelieving pagans, one is to represent things that bear no possible resemblance to anything...? For they, too, make such idols when they wish to mould the likeness of what they consider to be a god or, as they might say, one of the heroes or anything else of the kind, yet are unable even to approach a resemblance, and so delineate and represent some strange human shapes.

This a forceful stance against the mere presence of images in churches, similar to the Council of Elvira. As in that case, this behavior and attitude would not make sense, if early Christians had a practice of venerating images.

                            In light of the above evidence, it seems clear that the early Christians were not venerating icons of saints, angels, and the Lord, in the manner mandated under pain of damnation to Hell by the Second Council of Nicaea.

                            In conclusion, Jesus did not die on the cross, and bear our sins, and rise from the dead, so that we would have to venerate icons to be saved. The Second Council of Nicaea, accepted by most of the denominations who hold to the "baton passing" view of Apostolic succession, is an irreparable corruption of the Gospel, and what it mandates on pain of damnation has no place in the Bible, or in the early Church.

But some one says, in opposition to our proposition of "similitude being prohibited", "Why, then, did Moses in the desert make a likeness of a serpent out of bronze?" The figures, which used to be laid as a groundwork for some secret future dispensation, not with a view to the repeal of the law, but as a type of their own final cause, stand in a class by themselves.

It is enough that the same God, as by law He forbade the making of similitude, did, by the extraordinary precept in the case of the serpent, prohibit similitude. <b>If you reverence the same God, you have His law, "You shall make no similitude." If you look back, too, to the precept enjoining the subsequently made similitude, do you, too, imitate Moses: make not any likeness in opposition to the law, unless to you, too, God have bidden it.</b>

                                1 Since I have mentioned this city I do not think it proper to omit an account which is worthy of record for posterity. For they say that the woman with an issue of blood, who, as we learn from the sacred Gospel, received from our Saviour deliverance from her affliction, came from this place, and that her house is shown in the city, and that remarkable memorials of the kindness of the Saviour to her remain there. <br><br>

                                2 For there stands upon an elevated stone, by the gates of her house, a brazen image of a woman kneeling, with her hands stretched out, as if she were praying. Opposite this is another upright image of a man, made of the same material, clothed decently in a double cloak, and extending his hand toward the woman. At his feet, beside the statue itself, is a certain strange plant, which climbs up to the hem of the brazen cloak, and is a remedy for all kinds of diseases. <br><br>

                                3 They say that this statue is an image of Jesus. It has remained to our day, so that we ourselves also saw it when we were staying in the city. <br> <br>

                                4 Nor is it strange that those of the Gentiles who, of old, were benefited by our Saviour, should have done such things, since we have learned also that the likenesses of his apostles Paul and Peter, and of Christ himself, are preserved in paintings, the ancients being accustomed, as it is likely, according to a habit of the Gentiles, to pay this kind of honor indiscriminately to those regarded by them as deliverers.

No, it indicates the opposite.--> Also, Eusebius does not mention Byzantine-style veneration of the images, but rather, that they existed.

And graven images were worshipped by the commands of kings. <b>Whom men could not honour in presence because they dwelt afar off, they took the counterfeit of his visage from afar, and made an express image of the king whom they honoured, to the end that by this their forwardness they might flatter him that was absent as if he were present.</b> Also the singular diligence of the artificer did help to set forward the ignorant to more superstition: for he, perhaps, willing to please one in authority, forced all his skill to make the resemblance of the best fashion: and so the multitude, allured by the grace of the work, took him now for a god, which a little before was but honoured as a man: and this was an occasion to deceive the world, for men serving either calamity or tyranny, did ascribe unto stones and stocks the incommunicable Name.

                                We will examine, if you please, whence idolatry took its rise. A certain wise man tells us, that a certain rich man afflicted with untimely mourning for his son, and having no consolation for his sorrow, consoled his passion in this way: <b>having made a lifeless image of the dead, and constantly gazing at it, he seemed through the image to have his departed one still; while certain flatterers, whose God was their belly, treating the image with reverence in order to do him honor, carried on the custom into idolatry. So then it took its rise from weakness of soul, from a senseless custom, from extravagance.</b>
