                            One of the most powerful proofs against the Papacy for those with eyes still open to see the truth can be seen in simply recognizing that:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>217 out of the 266 Popes have been Italian</li>
                            <li>Many of the Popes have been closely related to each other, for instance:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Pope Hormisdas was the father of Pope Silverius</li>
                                    <!-- <li>Pope Agapetus I may have been related to Pope Felix III and Pope Gregory I</li> -->
                                    <li>Pope Felix III was the grandfather of Pope Gregory I</li>
                                    <li>Pope Stephen II was the brother of Pope Paul I</li>
                                    <li>Pope John XI was the uncle of Pope Benedict VII and Pope John XII, who himself was the half-uncle of the brothers Pope Benedict VIII and Pope John XIX, both of whom were uncles of Pope Benedict IX</li>
                                    <!-- <li>Pope Benedict VIII was the brother of Pope John XIX, and both were uncles of Pope Benedict IX</li> -->
                                    <li>Pope Gregory IX was the cousin of Pope Innocent III, and the uncle of Pope Alexander IV</li>
                                    <li>Pope Innocent IV was the uncle of Pope Adrian V</li>
                                    <li>Pope Honorius III was the granduncle of Pope Honorius IV</li>
                                    <li>Pope Callixtus III was the uncle of Pope Alexander VI</li>
                                    <li>Pope Clement VI was the uncle of Pope Gregory XI</li>
                                    <li>Pope Gregory XII was the uncle of Pope Eugene IV</li>
                                    <li>Pope Eugene IV was the uncle of Pope Paul II</li>
                                    <li>Pope Sixtus IV was the uncle of Pope Julius II</li>
                                    <li>Pope Pius II was the uncle of Pope Pius III</li>
                                    <li>Pope Leo X was the granduncle of Pope Leo XI, and the cousin of Pope Clement VII</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>From the 11th-19th century, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cardinal-nephews" target="_blank">nearly 70 Popes</a> appointed their relatives to be Cardinals, numbering around 200 - at least 15 of which later became Popes</li>
                            <li>Pope John XII was installed as Pope when he was 18 years old by his father Alberic II of Spoleto</li>
                            <li>Pope Benedict IX was installed as Pope when he was 20 years old by his father Alberic III of Tusculum
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Pope Benedict IX then sold the Papacy to Pope Gregory VI. He later tried to depose him, and a dispute between the two, plus another Italian noble, Pope Sylvester III, had to be settled by the Council of Sutri (1046 AD)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The above facts intuitively disprove the Papacy, because it is revealed to be nothing more than an Italian/Roman political office. The office "Vicar of Christ, the head of the whole church, and the father and teacher of all Christians" (Council of Florence, Vatican 1), were it available, wouldn't look like the above - a bunch of Italian sinners - many extremely wealthy noblemen and aristocrats - playing politics, and installing members from their clan. That's intuitive. The Papacy is false. 
                        </p>
                        <!-- <p class="article-body">
                            Adding to the above the fact that God knew all about China, India, Australia, and the Americas, when He gave the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20). Yet, isn't it incredible how all of God's "Vicars of Christ" came from a single area? God would never have instituted a Papacy, because of the Americas. If there is a dispute, there needs to be a local pastor who can make a decision. The entire world being ruled by a single bishop is ridiculous, in light of the size of the world. If the Roman Church hadn't totally failed in the Great Commission, there would have been hundreds of thousands of churches, all over the globe, and the Papacy model would certainly not have worked, in an age before the printing press and internet.
