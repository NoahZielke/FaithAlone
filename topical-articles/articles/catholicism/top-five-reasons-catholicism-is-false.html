                        <h3>1. Historical Contradictions</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            There are many historical contradictions within Roman Catholicism between Papal decrees and other Papal decrees, Papal decrees and Ecumenical Councils, and Ecumenical Councils with other Ecumenical Councils.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            For example, observe Pope Paul IV (1476-1559 AD) say that the Jews are "condemned to eternal slavery", says that they have "invaded Rome", and laments that they do not wear identifying garments so as to stand out from Christians:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>

                                Since it is completely senseless and inappropriate to be in a situation where Christian piety allows <b>the Jews (whose guilt - all of their own doing - has condemned them to eternal slavery)</b> access to our society and even to live among us; indeed, they are without gratitude to Christians, as, instead of thanks for gracious treatment, they return invective, and among themselves, <b>instead of the slavery, which they deserve, they manage to claim superiority:</b> we, who recently learned that these very Jews have insolently invaded Rome from a number of the Papal States, territories and domains, to the extent that not only have they mingled with Christians (even when close to their churches) and wearing no identifying garments, but to dwell in homes, indeed, even in the more noble [dwellings] of the states, territories and domains in which they lingered, conducting business from their houses and in the streets and dealing in real estate; they even have nurses and housemaids and other Christians as hired servants.

                        </p>

                                2 <b>This Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom.</b> This freedom means that <b>all men are to be immune from coercion</b> on the part of individuals or of social groups and of any human power, in such wise that <b>no one is to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his own beliefs, whether privately or publicly,</b> whether alone or in association with others, within due limits. <br> <br>

                            These examples disprove the Roman Catholic assertion that their Church is the infallible teacher of all Christians. Rather, it is a fallible institution, which merely makes bold claims which do not withstand the test of historical scrutiny.

                        <h3 class="pt-2">2. The Marian Dogmas</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The two most recent dogmas to be infallibly defined by the Pope were both in relation to Mary: 
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>The Immaculate Conception (1854 AD) - Mary was conceived by her mother without Original Sin</li>
                            <li>The Assumption (1950 AD) - Mary was bodily assumed to Heaven</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            According to the Roman Catholic Church, both of these dogmas are required to be believed by all Christians. If one rejects the Immaculate Conception, they are "separated from the unity of the Church" (Ineffabilis Deus, 1854 AD). If one rejects the Assumption, they "will incur the wrath of Almighty God and of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul" (Munificentissimus Deus, 1950 AD). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Beginning with the Immaculate Conception - covered in its own <a href="../catholicism/immaculate-conception.html" target="_blank">article here</a> - this doctrine was explicitly rejected by five Saints, four of whom are also Doctors of the Church:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>John Chrysostom (347-407 AD)</li>
                            <li>Augustine (354-430 AD)</li>
                            <li>Fulgentius of Ruspe (460-533 AD)</li>
                            <li>Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153 AD)</li>
                            <li>Thomas Aquinas (1224-1274 AD)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Notice that even late into the 13th century, the most prominent Catholic writer of the last 1,000 years, Thomas Aquinas, explicitly rejected the doctrine as "derogatory to the dignity of Christ" (Summa Theologica, Part 3, Question 27, Article 2). Yet, in 1854, Pope Pius IX (1792-1878 AD) made it a required belief for Salvation. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Biblically speaking, Mary was a sinner. God explicitly recorded her making a "sin offering" for an "atonement for her" in the text of the New Testament (Luke 2:24, Leviticus 12:6-8), without inspiring Luke to give any indication whatsoever that this was somehow unnecessary, or not for all the purposes that it was said to be for in the Law. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Assumption of Mary - covered in its own <a href="../catholicism/assumption.html" target="_blank">article here</a> - has an even worse historical record than the Immaculate Conception. It is entirely absent from the existing writings of the Ante-Nicene (pre-325 AD) Christian writers, many of whom spoke about Mary at length. It does not make sense for such a momentous event, if it actually happened, to be altogether absent from Scripture, as well as the writings of the early Church.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Further, in a work by Epiphanius (310-403 AD) in which Mary is mentioned <i>hundreds</i> of times, not only does he never mention the Assumption, but he explicitly says that "No one knows her end", after speculating on what happened to her:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Epiphanius (310-403 AD) - The Panarion, Antidicomarians 23</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                8 And there have been many such things to mislead the deluded, though the saints are not responsible for anyone's stumbling; the human mind finds no rest, but is perverted to evils. The holy virgin may have died and been buried - her falling asleep was with honor, her death in purity, her crown in virginity. Or she may have been put to death - as the scripture says, "And a sword shall pierce through her soul" - her fame is among the martyrs and her holy body, by which light rose on the world, [rests] amid blessings. Or she may have remained alive, for God is not incapable of doing whatever he wills. <b>No one knows her end. </b>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Therefore, not only are these doctrines found nowhere in Scripture, but they are also ahistorical, either lacking historical attestation, or even being explicitly repudiated by those whom the Catholic Church views as authoritative teachers.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            These dogmas are also part of a broader stream of Mariolatry - excessive exaltation of Mary - that abounds in Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, which is extensively documented in <a href="../catholicism/akathist-hymn.html" target="_blank">this article</a>, and represents an entirely different religion from that of the New Testament. Also see the aforementioned articles for a much more thorough presentation of the problems involved with each Marian dogma, including quotations from the early Christian writers mentioned above.

                        <h3>3. The Papacy</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The concept of the Papacy has no Biblical support. Peter does not act as a Pope, none of the Apostles refer to a Papacy, or needing to submit to Peter or Rome, and even up to the very end of Christ's ministry, the Apostles were disagreeing amongst themselves as to who would be the greatest (Luke 22:24-30). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In Galatians 2:11-14, Paul directly and publicly rebukes Peter for his errant behavior at Antioch. At the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, it is James, not Peter, who delivers the final judgment (Acts 15:19-23), and the letter containing the judgement is written, not in the name of Peter, but in the name of the "apostles and elders and brethren" (Acts 15:23). 
                        </p>

                            The three most common Roman Catholic proof texts for the Papacy do not, in context, teach anything resembling the modern concept of the Papacy:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Matthew 16:13-20 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The Lord asks a question - "Whom say ye that I am?" (Matthew 16:15). Peter answers "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God" (Matthew 16:16), which is the thesis statement of the New Testament (John 20:31: 1 John 5:1, etc.). The Lord responds that God revealed that truth to Peter, and that "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" (Matthew 16:18). There are two potential interpretations of this passage which make the most sense, Biblically speaking:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The first would be to say that "this rock" refers to Peter's confession that Jesus is the Messiah, and the Son of God, which Jesus has just said was revealed to Peter by God in the preceding sentence </li>
                                            <li>The second would be to say that Peter is a rock the Church is built upon in the sense that he, as an Apostle, is part of the foundation of the Church, which is "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone" (Ephesians 2:20). The Roman Catholic error, then, would be to assert that rather than being a rock that Jesus built His Church upon, Peter was the <i>only</i> rock, to the exclusion of all others, or that this is somehow a statement about a perpetual autocratic office to be filled by unmentioned "successors" of Peter in one of the churches that he helped found - nothing of that sort is mentioned at all</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <!-- In the parallel passages in Mark and Luke where this event is recorded, the Lord's mention of Peter is not recorded, but his confession is, because that is the essential element of the passage (Mark 8:27-30, Luke 9:18-21) -->
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The Lord says to Peter "I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:19). In Matthew 18:17-18, this is shown to be in reference to <i>Church discipline</i>, and it is a power given to all of the Apostles, not just Peter (Matthew 18:1)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>John 21:15-17
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This is a simple threefold restoration after Peter's threefold denial of Jesus, which the other Apostles were not guilty of. There is no indication that Peter <i>alone</i> is solely responsible for shepherding God's flock. Rather, the elders in Ephesus are told "Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood" (Acts 20:28)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Luke 22:31-32
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Peter is simply instructed to strengthen his brothers after he himself is strengthened by Christ, after his restoration, following his denial of the Lord. The same Greek term is used of others' ministry in Romans 1:11, and 1 Thessalonians 3:2, and a something very similar is likewise said of others in Acts 15:32, 15:4</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            Because the Roman Catholic interpretation of Matthew 16 is so vital to the doctrine of the Papacy, it is worth noting that historically, the Catholic interpretation of Matthew 16:18 is a minority position:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">James White - The Roman Catholic Controversy - Chapter 8, pg. 120</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                The French Roman Catholic Launoy (1603-1678 AD) surveyed the patristic evidence and found seventeen citations supporting the concept that Peter is the rock of Matthew 16. Please note that this does not mean that all sixteen of these Fathers also felt that this meant that the bishop of Rome was a Pope, but only that they saw Matthew 16 and the phrase "this rock" as referring to Peter. However, Launoy found sixteen citations that identified the rock as Christ. He found eight that identified all the Apostles together as forming the rock of Matthew 16. And he found forty-four citations indicating that the rock of Matthew 16 was the confession of faith made by Peter in Jesus Christ. <br> <br>

                                If we add these numbers together, we find that the Roman Catholic position, which claims to have <i>always</i> been the faith of the Catholic Church, in Launoy's survey actually represents twenty percent of the Fathers (17/85). Eighty percent of the time, then, the early Fathers expressed, in Vatican I's words, "perverse" opinions at the very best. I might note that even as late as the Council of Trent it was said this passage was referring to the faith that Peter expressed.

                            The Biblical case for the Papacy requires a severe over-reading of a few texts, which do not at all clearly state what the Roman Catholic Church demands of them to teach their doctrine. If the Papacy were a legitimate and Biblical institution, it would not be built on a few modest or ambiguous passages. Such an important doctrine would be taught very clearly, and such an office would be featured prominently in the early Church's many controversies, in a way that is known historically to not have been the case.

Victor then, in direct violation of Romans 14:4-6 and Colossians 2:14-17, attempted to excommunicate all the churches in Asia who celebrated Passover on a different day. However, "this did not please all the bishops. And they besought him to consider the things of peace, and of neighborly unity and love. Words of theirs are extant, sharply rebuking Victor" (Eusebius - Ecclesiastical History, Book 5, Chapter 24), among them Irenaeus (130-202 AD).

                                The Twenty-Seventh Pope is Stephen VI, who can be joined with the Twenty Eight Pope accused of error, Sergius III. It is certain from Platina and others, that Stephen invalidated the acts of Pope Formosus, his predecessor, and commanded those ordained by him to be ordained again. Hence he thought that the Sacrament depended upon the virtue of the minister, which is a manifest error in faith. For that reason, Pope John IX afterward invalidated the acts of Stephen VI and approved the acts of Formosus. But a little afterward, Sergius III again invalidated the acts of Formosus, and hence also of John, and approved the acts of Stephen. Necessarily, one of these Popes was opposed to the others and erred, as the Centuriators diligently observed.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Catholic Canon of Scripture, defined infallibly at the Council of Trent (1545-1563 AD), differs from the Protestant and Jewish Bible in the Old Testament with the addition of the following books:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">

                            <li>1 & 2 Maccabees</li>
                            <li>Sirach (Ecclesiasticus)</li>
                            <li>Tobit</li>
                            <li>Wisdom</li>
                            <li>There are also Greek additions to Daniel and Esther - books originally written in Hebrew and Aramaic</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            None of the above books are quoted as Scripture in the New Testament. Further, the canon of the Jews at the time of Christ, as attested to by the first-century Jewish witness Josephus (37-100 AD), excludes these apocryphal books:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Josephus (37-100 AD) - Against Apion, Book 1</h5>

                                8 For we have not an innumerable multitude of books among us, disagreeing from and contradicting one another, [as the Greeks have,] but only twenty-two books, which contain the records of all the past times; which are justly believed to be divine; and of them five belong to Moses, which contain his laws and the traditions of the origin of mankind till his death. This interval of time was little short of three thousand years; but as to the time from the death of Moses till the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, who reigned after Xerxes, the prophets, who were after Moses, wrote down what was done in their times in thirteen books. The remaining four books contain hymns to God, and precepts for the conduct of human life. <br> <br>

                                It is true, our history hath been written since Artaxerxes very particularly, but hath not been esteemed of the like authority with the former by our forefathers, because there hath not been an exact succession of prophets since that time; and how firmly we have given credit to these books of our own nation is evident by what we do; <b>for during so many ages as have already passed, no one has been so bold as either to add any thing to them, to take any thing from them, or to make any change in them; but it is become natural to all Jews immediately, and from their very birth, to esteem these books to contain Divine doctrines, and to persist in them, and, if occasion be willingly to die for them.</b>

                            Above, Josephus enumerates 22 books, which are the same 39 books of the Protestant Old Testament, grouped according to Jewish tradition. This is significant, because before the New Testament Church, the Jews were the people of God, who were entrusted with the writings of the prophets (Romans 3:1-2). And, their canon excluded the Roman Catholic Apocrypha.

                            The Roman Catholic Church is a false denomination of Christianity. It does not withstand Biblical or historical scrutiny, and has often perpetrated horrible things against those who disagreed with it on matters of doctrine, making their errors and relentless condemnations of all other Christians even more egregious, in spite of their modern hypocritical attempts to appear ecumenical:

                                Urged by faith, we are obliged to believe and to maintain that the Church is one, holy, catholic, and also apostolic. <b>We believe in her firmly and we confess with simplicity that outside of her there is neither salvation nor the remission of sins</b> <br> <br>

                                Furthermore, we declare, we proclaim, we define that <b>it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff.</b>
