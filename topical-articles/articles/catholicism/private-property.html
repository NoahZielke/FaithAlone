                            Since the advent of Socialism, various Popes have addressed the topic of private property in their encyclicals. The primary encyclicals dealing with the topic are:

                            The Popes have varied in their stances on the principals of Communism, some demonstrating explicit hostility, others explicit favor. This article will focus on one such explicit contradiction - certainly in sentiment, but also even in the exact language used. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In 1891, Pope Leo XIII issued Rerum Novarum, which directly attacked the Communist view on private property. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In it, he says: 
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Pope Leo XIII - Rerum Novarum (1891 AD)</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                5 Socialists, therefore, by endeavoring to transfer the possessions of individuals to the community at large, strike at the interests of every wage-earner, since they would deprive him of the liberty of disposing of his wages, and thereby of all hope and possibility of increasing his resources and of bettering his condition in life.  <br> <br>
                            
                                6 What is of far greater moment, however, is the fact that the remedy they propose is manifestly against justice. For, every man has by nature the right to possess property as his own.  <br> <br>
                            
                                15 Hence, it is clear that the main tenet of socialism, community of goods, must be utterly rejected, since it only injures those whom it would seem meant to benefit, is directly contrary to the natural rights of mankind, and would introduce confusion and disorder into the commonweal. <b>The first and most fundamental principle, therefore, if one would undertake to alleviate the condition of the masses, must be the inviolability of private property.</b> This being established, we proceed to show where the remedy sought for must be found. <br> <br>

                                46 If a workman's wages be sufficient to enable him comfortably to support himself, his wife, and his children, he will find it easy, if he be a sensible man, to practice thrift, and he will not fail, by cutting down expenses, to put by some little savings and thus secure a modest source of income. Nature itself would urge him to this. We have seen that this great labor question cannot be solved save by assuming as a principle that <b>private ownership must be held sacred and inviolable.</b> The law, therefore, should favor ownership, and its policy should be to induce as many as possible of the people to become owners.
                            </p>

                            The message is clearly anti-Communist. He rejects the socialization of private property, and defines respect for private property as the "first and most fundamental" way to alleviate the suffering of the masses. "By nature", every man has "the right to possess property as his own". 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            However, we see an altogether different viewpoint on this topic in Fratelli Tutti (2020 AD), issued by Pope Francis. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In it, we read: 
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Pope Francis - Fratelli Tutti (2020 AD)</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                120 Once more, I would like to echo a statement of Saint John Paul II whose forcefulness has perhaps been insufficiently recognized: "God gave the earth to the whole human race for the sustenance of all its members, without excluding or favouring anyone". <b>For my part, I would observe that "the Christian tradition has never recognized the right to private property as absolute or inviolable,</b> and has stressed the social purpose of all forms of private property". The principle of the common use of created goods is the "first principle of the whole ethical and social order"; it is a natural and inherent right that takes priority over others. <br> <br>

                                All other rights having to do with the goods necessary for the integral fulfilment of persons, including that of private property or any other type of property, should – in the words of Saint Paul VI – “in no way hinder [this right], but should actively facilitate its implementation”. The right to private property can only be considered a secondary natural right, derived from the principle of the universal destination of created goods.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The sentiment of this encyclical is opposed to the sentiment expressed in Rerum Novarum. Pay special attention to the bolded part of each quotation. Pope Leo XIII says "The first and most fundamental principle, therefore, if one would undertake to alleviate the condition of the masses, must be the inviolability of private property". Pope Francis says "For my part, I would observe that the Christian tradition has never recognized the right to private property as absolute or inviolable". This is a direct contradiction. Even if the words are massaged, the sentiments of the encyclicals, and clearly, the beliefs of the men writing them, are irreconcilably different. Pope Leo XIII would be, in modern terms, a Conservative. Pope Francis is a Liberal.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Pope Leo XIII also says that the inviolability of private property must be "The first and most fundamental principle", whereas Pope Francis says "The right to private property can only be considered a secondary natural right". This is yet another direct contradiction, reflecting two opposing worldviews. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This also must be recognized as a contradiction between two Popes on "a matter of faith and morals", because one's views on private property definitely affect what one considers to be "moral" actions with regard to dealing with their property, and other's property. The Popes infallibly contradict each other, because they are fallible human beings. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This is but one example of how having an Infallible Pontiff does not create clarity. They contradict each other, and the fact remains that, just as Protestants must interpret the Bible, Catholics must interpret what the Popes are saying. The difference is, with the non-inspired words of the Pope, there is no guarantee of consistency or coherence, as there is in the Word of God. 
                        </p>

                            Further, Francis's embrace of Socialism demonstrates that he rejects the New Testament, which respects the right to private property (Acts 5:3-4: 2 Corinthians 9:7). Private accumulation and use of private property, for the purpose of benefiting the owner, is not sinful. Those who understand the talking points of Socialism, and what they are designed to communicate, recognize that Pope Francis is demonstrating his support for Leftist Socialist sentiments, which are fundamentally aimed at villainizing people with money, without regard for how that money was obtained, and how they intend to use it in the future.

In consequence he has been endowed by God with many and varied prerogatives: the right to life, to bodily integrity, to the necessary means of existence; the right to tend toward his ultimate goal in the path marked out for him by God; the right of association and the right to possess and use property.
                            50 Is it not deplorable that the right of private property defended by the Church should so often have been used as a weapon to defraud the workingman of his just salary and his social rights?

                            The Use of Private Property

                            23. "He who has the goods of this world and sees his brother in need and closes his heart to him, how does the love of God abide in him?" (21) Everyone knows that the Fathers of the Church laid down the duty of the rich toward the poor in no uncertain terms. As St. Ambrose put it: "You are not making a gift of what is yours to the poor man, but you are giving him back what is his. You have been appropriating things that are meant to be for the common use of everyone. The earth belongs to everyone, not to the rich." (22) These words indicate that the right to private property is not absolute and unconditional.

                            No one may appropriate surplus goods solely for his own private use when others lack the bare necessities of life. In short, "as the Fathers of the Church and other eminent theologians tell us, the right of private property may never be exercised to the detriment of the common good." When "private gain and basic community needs conflict with one another," it is for the public authorities "to seek a solution to these questions, with the active involvement of individual citizens and social groups." (23)
