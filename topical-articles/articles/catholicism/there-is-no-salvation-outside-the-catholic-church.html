                        <h3>The Catholic Church's Historical Teaching</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Historically, the Catholic Church has taught explicitly that unless one is a Roman Catholic, they will go to Hell. This is known as Extra Ecclesiam Nulla Salus - "Outside of the Church, there is no Salvation".
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            For instance, Pope Boniface VIII's (1230-1303 AD) Ex Cathedra Papal Bull <i>Unam Sanctam</i> states:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>

                                Urged by faith, we are obliged to believe and to maintain that the Church is one, holy, catholic, and also apostolic. <b>We believe in her firmly and we confess with simplicity that outside of her there is neither salvation nor the remission of sins</b> <br> <br>

                                <b>Therefore, if the Greeks or others should say that they are not confided to Peter and to his successors, they must confess not being the sheep of Christ,</b> since Our Lord says in John "there is one sheepfold and one shepherd." <br> <br>

                                Furthermore, we declare, we proclaim, we define that <b>it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff.</b>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Notice that "subjection to the Roman Pontiff" is explicity defined as a requirement for Salvation. And, non-Catholics, namely the Greek Orthodox, "or others" who are not under the Pope, the Church confesses as "not being the sheep of Christ". Also, the fact that this condemns all non-Catholics is manifest by his use of of the term "every human creature" - which clearly is intended to encompass all people, regardless of their profession of faith.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Another clear testament to there being no Salvation outside the Roman Catholic Church is the Ex Cathedra Papal Bull Cantate Domino, issued by Pope Eugene IV (1383-1447 AD), which was incorporated into the Council of Florence (1445 AD):

                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Above, "heretics", which are Christians who believe false doctrines, are explicitly called out as those who are to be damned - "even if he has shed blood for the name of Christ". Pagans and Jews are also explicitly named as those who are to be damned. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            "Schismatics" are also among those listed who "cannot become participants in eternal life". The Catholic Church defines the sin of schism to be refusing to submit to the Pope, meaning that all non-Catholics are, by definition, "schismatics":

                            The Council of Trent pronounces Anathemas on scores of offenses and heresies - over 130. For the Catholic definition of "Anathema", we can consult the Catholic Encyclopedia, which quotes the formal Anathema pronouncement:

Pronouncing an Anathema on someone is authoritatively consigning them to Hell, as they are being declared to be outside of the Church - "outside of which there is absolutely no Salvation" (Fourth Lateran Council, 1215 AD).

                        <p class="article-body">
                            The first prominent indication of an authoritative change in teaching on this issue can be seen in an Encyclical of Pope Pius IX (1792-1878 AD), entitled Quanto Conficiamur Moerore:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Pope Pius IX - Quanto Conficiamur Moerore (1863 AD)</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                7 Here, too, our beloved sons and venerable brothers, it is again necessary to mention and censure a very grave error entrapping some Catholics who believe that it is possible to arrive at eternal salvation although living in error and alienated from the true faith and Catholic unity. Such belief is certainly opposed to Catholic teaching. There are, of course, those who are struggling with invincible ignorance about our most holy religion. Sincerely observing the natural law and its precepts inscribed by God on all hearts and ready to obey God, they live honest lives and are able to attain eternal life by the efficacious virtue of divine light and grace. Because God knows, searches and clearly understands the minds, hearts, thoughts, and nature of all, his supreme kindness and clemency do not permit anyone at all who is not guilty of deliberate sin to suffer eternal punishments. <br> <br>

                                8 Also well known is the Catholic teaching that no one can be saved outside the Catholic Church. Eternal salvation cannot be obtained by those who oppose the authority and statements of the same Church and are stubbornly separated from the unity of the Church and also from the successor of Peter, the Roman Pontiff, to whom "the custody of the vineyard has been committed by the Savior."

                            Above, notice two important details:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>For the first time, official Papal support is given to the concept of "invincible ignorance". This teaches that someone will not go to Hell, so long as they live exemplary lives, and are sufficiently ignorant of the truth, even if they are non-Catholic</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            It should be noted that a traditionalist view of the concept of invincible ignorance as taught by Pope Pius IX is that invincible ignorance does not save a person. It simply means that one does not incur the specific sin for rejecting a truth that they have not been exposed to. In other words, they still do not have the new birth, conferred by baptism, and are lost, but are not condemned specifically for rejecting all of the teachings that they are ignorant of.

                            Regardless, the concept of invincible ignorance would provide the basis for a wholesale overthrow of Catholic teaching regarding Extra Ecclesiam Nulla Salus.

                            This complete overthrow took place during the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965 AD). In one of the declarations entitled Lumen Gentium, they begin by affirming Pius IX's position in Quanto Conficiamur Moerore:

                                14 This Sacred Council wishes to turn its attention firstly to the Catholic faithful. Basing itself upon Sacred Scripture and Tradition, <b>it teaches that the Church, now sojourning on earth as an exile, is necessary for salvation.</b> Christ, present to us in His Body, which is the Church, is the one Mediator and the unique way of salvation. In explicit terms He Himself affirmed the necessity of faith and baptism and thereby affirmed also the necessity of the Church, for through baptism as through a door men enter the Church. <b>Whosoever, therefore, knowing that the Catholic Church was made necessary by Christ, would refuse to enter or to remain in it, could not be saved.</b>

                                3 The Church regards with esteem also the Moslems. They adore the one God, living and subsisting in Himself; merciful and all-powerful, the Creator of heaven and earth, who has spoken to men; they take pains to submit wholeheartedly to even His inscrutable decrees, just as Abraham, with whom the faith of Islam takes pleasure in linking itself, submitted to God. Though they do not acknowledge Jesus as God, they revere Him as a prophet. They also honor Mary, His virgin Mother; at times they even call on her with devotion. In addition, they await the day of judgment when God will render their deserts to all those who have been raised up from the dead. Finally, they value the moral life and worship God especially through prayer, almsgiving and fasting.

                            The above states that "They adore the one God", and "worship God, especially through prayer, almsgiving, and fasting". The issue, Biblically, is that they do no such thing. They worship an idol (1 Chronicles 16:26), who is a demon (1 Corinthians 10:20). Extolling Allah as "merciful and all-powerful" is merely referring to their suppositions, which are actually self-deception and lies. This only serves to appeal to their delusion, and perpetuate their error.

                                3 For men who believe in Christ and have been truly baptized are in communion with the Catholic Church even though this communion is imperfect. The differences that exist in varying degrees between them and the Catholic Church - whether in doctrine and sometimes in discipline, or concerning the structure of the Church - do indeed create many obstacles, sometimes serious ones, to full ecclesiastical communion. The ecumenical movement is striving to overcome these obstacles. <b>But even in spite of them it remains true that all who have been justified by faith in Baptism are members of Christ's body, and have a right to be called Christian, and so are correctly accepted as brothers by the children of the Catholic Church.</b> <br> <br>

                            For most of its history, the Roman Catholic Church taught that all non-Roman Catholics would be damned, with absolutely no caveats ever mentioned or provided for. In modern times, they have contradicted this doctrine, with the introduction of invincible ignorance, which in Vatican 2, was extended to encompass groups which previous Popes and Councils explicitly anathematized.

                            The concept of invincible ignorance is rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of how a person is justified before God. We are justified in the sight of God by the imputed righteousness of Christ, when we believe in Him (Romans 3:21-22, 4:4-8). Outside of that, there is no Salvation, because none can be justified by living a righteous life (Romans 3:20). For this reason, the Bible is clear in teaching that all non-believers will go to Hell (John 3:18, 3:36, 8:24, 14:6, Mark 16:16, Acts 4:12: 1 John 5:12).

Rather, it is the body of Christ (Ephesians 1:22-23, Colossians 1:18, 1:24)<!--Romans 12:5, 1 Corinthians 12:27, Ephesians 5:23-->, which consists of every believer in Jesus. The historical Catholic Church misdefined the Church as the <i>Roman Catholic Church</i>, and the modern Catholic Church rejects the entire Biblical doctrine, except in a token, meaningless way, which removes any meaningful definition of the Church.

So, too, St. Cyprian: "To be in communion with Cornelius is to be in communion with the Catholic Church" (Ep. lv., n. 1). In the same way Maximus the Abbot teaches that <b>obedience to the Roman Pontiff is the proof of the true faith and of legitimate communion.</b> Therefore if a man does not want to be, or to be called, a heretic, let him not strive to please this or that man...but let him hasten before all things to be in communion with the Roman See.
