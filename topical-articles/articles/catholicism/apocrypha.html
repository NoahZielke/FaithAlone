                        <p class="article-body">
                            The 39 books of the Old Testament in a Protestant Bible are the same 39 books in an Orthodox Jewish Bible, which is Biblically significant (Romans 3:1-2). The Jews count these as either 22 or 24 books, using the following rules in distinction from the typical Protestant enumeration:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>1 & 2 Samuel are counted as one book</li>
                            <li>1 & 2 Kings are counted as one book</li>
                            <li>1 & 2 Chronicles are counted as one book </li>
                            <li>Ezra and Nehemiah are counted as one book</li>
                            <li>The Twelve Minor Prophets are counted as one book</li>
                            <li>In the 22-book count, Ruth is combined with Judges, and Lamentations is combined with Jeremiah</li>
                            <li>In the 24-book count, Ruth and Lamentations are counted as separate books. This is the more popular way of counting the books today</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Historically, these canonical Old Testament books were divided into three groups by the Jews - The Law, the Prophets, and the Writings (Luke 24:44). From before the time of Christ, to the present day, these books have been regarded by Jews as being intrinsically superior in comparison to any other writings, as attested to by the first-century Jewish witness Josephus (37-100 AD):

                                8 For we have not an innumerable multitude of books among us, disagreeing from and contradicting one another, [as the Greeks have,] but only twenty-two books, which contain the records of all the past times; which are justly believed to be divine; and of them five belong to Moses, which contain his laws and the traditions of the origin of mankind till his death. This interval of time was little short of three thousand years; but as to the time from the death of Moses till the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, who reigned after Xerxes, the prophets, who were after Moses, wrote down what was done in their times in thirteen books. The remaining four books contain hymns to God, and precepts for the conduct of human life. <br> <br>

                                It is true, our history hath been written since Artaxerxes very particularly, but hath not been esteemed of the like authority with the former by our forefathers, because there hath not been an exact succession of prophets since that time; and how firmly we have given credit to these books of our own nation is evident by what we do; <b>for during so many ages as have already passed, no one has been so bold as either to add any thing to them, to take any thing from them, or to make any change in them; but it is become natural to all Jews immediately, and from their very birth, to esteem these books to contain Divine doctrines, and to persist in them, and, if occasion be willingly to die for them.</b>

                            Notice especially that Josephus is speaking of what "is natural to all Jews", and says that "during so many ages as have already passed" - that is, for a considerable time before himself - "no one has been so bold as either to add any thing to them, to take any thing from them, or to make any change in them". This would indicate that he views his statement on the 22-book canon as rather universal, established, and uncontroversial.

                            Note that a reference or an allusion to a text in the New Testament is not good enough to establish its canonicity. Jude cites from the book of Enoch, and potentially the Assumption of Moses (Jude 1:9, 14-15) - neither of which are considered canonical by Catholics or Eastern Orthodox. Likewise the Apostle Paul cites the Greek poets Aratus (Acts 17:28), Menander or Euripides (1 Corinthians 15:33), and Epimenides (Titus 1:12). There are also many references or allusions to other apocryphal books not considered inspired by Catholics or Eastern Orthodox, such as 3 & 4 Maccabees, the Psalms of Solomon, the Testament of Levi, and the Testament of Joseph. Therefore, in order to declare a text canonical based on New Testament citation alone, it would need to be formally cited as Scripture, in the manner of the references above.

                            Therefore, the New Testament and Jewish evidence is strongly in favor of the Protestant view that there were 39 books, which were considered <i>ontologically different</i> from other writings, in that they were recognized as having been inspired by God (2 Timothy 3:16). Those to whom the oracles were delivered (Romans 3:1-2) did not recognize the additional apocryphal books as having been inspired, and no direct quotation of them as Scripture compels us to accept them in spite of that.

                            The first time that this canon was infallibly defined by the Roman Catholic Church was during the Council of Trent (1545-1563 AD), which repeated the canon elucidated in the earlier local North African councils of Hippo (393 AD) and Carthage (397 AD):

However, Orthodox Bibles commonly include the entire Catholic canon, plus 3 Maccabees, the Prayer of Manasseh, Psalm 151, and 1 Esdras.

                            Note that this is not an invalid argument from silence. When one is enumerating a list of books of Scripture, they do not leave out books which they are aware of, and they reckon to be inspired. Therefore, we can assume that each of these writers were, at the very least, not aware of them - meaning they were not in universal use in the early Church - or that they were aware of them, and did not reckon them to be inspired Scripture - which was explicitly stated by some of the above writers (e.g. Athanasius, Jerome, Rufinus, John of Damascus).

                                Several complaints have been lodged against the historical reliability of 1 Maccabees. The nationalism of its author and the exaggerated importance he gives Judean events (1:41-43; 3:27-31; 6:5-13) are said to make his objectivity suspect. He is anti-Seleucid (1:9-10), and, moreover, he shows ignorance of the history, geography, and political organization of foreign peoples. His Jewish nationalism leads him to inflate the numbers of the enemy, so as to have a more striking divine intervention on behalf of the Hasmoneans. And he has erred in placing the death of Antiochus IV after the dedication of the Temple. These and other historical shortcomings are thought to discredit him as a reliable reporter of the period.

                                To have its proper spot in history, 2 Maccabees 11 should be moved to follow chapter 8. As it now stands, chapter 11 errs in attributing this campaign of Lysias to the reign of the next king, Antiochus V Eupator (who succeeds Epiphanes in 2 Maccabees 10:10-11). The mistake occurred because the epitomist associated Lysias's campaign and the three letters from Epiphanes' reign (11:16-21, 27-33, 34-38) with the letter of his son Eupator (11:22-26). Assigning all the material to Eupator, the epitomist made this first campaign of Lysias follow the death of Antiochus IV, whereas in reality it had preceded it.

                                This reformed chronology demands a revised sequence of the events in 1-2 Maccabees. The latter is correct in placing the death of Antiochus IV Epiphanes before the Temple's dedication (2 Maccabees 9:1-29; 10:1-9), and 1 Maccabees has the wrong order (1 Maccabees 4:36-61; 6:1-17). Antiochus died toward October of 164 BC (in the Seleucid year 148, if one begins the year in the spring, as B. M. Tablet 35603 does; in the Seleucid year 149, if one counts from autumn as 1 Maccabees 6:16 does), and the Temple was dedicated on December 14, 164 BC (1 Maccabees 4:52; 25 Kisleu, year 148 of the Seleucids, counted this time as beginning in the spring). Correct placement of Antiochus's death in 1 Maccabees requires the moving of 1 Maccabees 6:1-17 to precede 4:36-61.

The absence of a number before "month" is strange, but it is generally agreed that the fifth month is intended; the date of composition is just prior to Ab 7, 582, the fifth anniversary of the burning of Jerusalem on Aug. 25, 587 (2 Kings 25:8). That is the occasion for the assembly of 1:3 at which the confession and prayer were first read. But this understanding of the passage presents serious difficulties. First, the introduction (1:10-14) presumes that the Temple is standing and that the services are being conducted in the normal manner; 1:2 itself and what is known from other sources (2 Kings 25:8-10; Ezra 3:1-13) indicate that such was not the case in 582.

                                The Greek additions are universally acknowledged to be religious and devotional commentary composed out of the religious convictions and fertile imaginations of later translators/authors. They change radically the focus of the original story by giving the heroic role to God rather than to Mordecai and Esther. They also greatly expand the horizons of the story by giving it an apocalyptic perspective through the dream of Mordecai that introduces the story and the interpretation of that dream at the end; the story thus takes on cosmic proportions.

                                The sections added by the Greek translator/author change the focus of the book and affect its teaching. Where the emphasis had been on the courage and resourcefulness of Mordecai and Esther it is now shifted to the intervention of God. Indeed, not only is the subtlety of the Hebrew story lost but the religious emphasis is so overdone as to be somewhat tedious.

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Canon of Scripture is not declared, but rather, recognized. God inspired certain writings, and it took the Church some time to recognize which books were of that inspired character. A book does not become inspired by fiat. The Apocrypha is not inspired by God in the way the Old Testament is, and therefore, it does not belong in the Bible. The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches are in error in this regard. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Appendix I - The Septuagint</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Some Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians argue that the Septuagint was the Bible of the early Church, and the Septuagint contained the Apocrypha. Therefore, the Apocrypha is inspired. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This conflates the term "Septuagint", which has come to mean a Greek translation of the Old Testament, with certain Biblical <i>manuscripts</i> that are from hundreds of years after the time of Jesus, and contain other books <i>alongside</i> the Old and New Testaments, in Greek.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            For instance, the three most important manuscripts in this discussion are typically as follows:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Codex Vaticanus (4th century AD) - Does not contain 1 & 2 Maccabees</li>
                            <li>Codex Sinaiticus (4th century AD) - Does not contain 2 Maccabees, and contains 4 Maccabees, the Epistle of Barnabas, and the Shepherd of Hermas</li>
                            <li>Codex Alexandrinus (5th century AD) - Contains 3 & 4 Maccabees, Psalm 151, the Book of Odes, the Epistle to Marcellinus, and 1 & 2 Clement</li> <!-- Also contains Eusebius's Summary of the Book of Psalms -->
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Therefore, a book being present in a later Greek manuscript of the Bible does not mean it was considered canonical at the time of Jesus Christ, or even that it was considered canonical at the time the manuscript was compiled. 
                        </p>

And of the other historical books, the first and second books of the Kings 8 are among the Hebrews one book; also the third and fourth 8b one book.

To this some add Tobit and Judith to make twenty-four books, according to the number of the Greek letters, which is the language used among Hebrews and Greeks gathered in Rome.

                                4 There are, then, of the Old Testament, twenty-two books in number; for, as I have heard, it is handed down that this is the number of the letters among the Hebrews; their respective order and names being as follows. The first is Genesis, then Exodus, next Leviticus, after that Numbers, and then Deuteronomy. Following these there is Joshua, the son of Nun, then Judges, then Ruth. And again, after these four books of Kings, the first and second being reckoned as one book, and so likewise the third and fourth as one book. And again, the first and second of the Chronicles are reckoned as one book. Again Ezra, the first and second are similarly one book. After these there is the book of Psalms, then the Proverbs, next Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs. Job follows, then the Prophets, the twelve being reckoned as one book. Then Isaiah, one book, then Jeremiah with Baruch, Lamentations, and the epistle, one book; afterwards, Ezekiel and Daniel, each one book. Thus far constitutes the Old Testament. <br> <br>

                                The divine oracles should always on the tongue and in the mind be rehearsed. For God will indeed give a reward for this labor, so that you may obtain light from anything hidden, or, what is far better, that you may be spurred by God to greater purity, and thirdly, be called away from the cares of the world by such study. But let not extraneous books seduce your mind. For many malignant writings have been disseminated. Accept, o friend, this my approved number. These are all twelve of the historical books, of the most ancient Hebrew wisdom: First there is Genesis, then Exodus, Leviticus too. Then Numbers, and the Second Law. Then Joshua and Judges. Ruth is eighth. The ninth and tenth books [are] the acts of Kings, and [the eleventh is] Chronicles. Last you have Ezra. The poetic books are five: Job being first, then [the Psalms of] David; and three of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Canticles and Proverbs. And similarly five of prophetic inspiration. There are the Twelve written in one book: Hosea and Amos, and Micah the third; then Joel, and Jonah, Obadiah, Nahum also, and Habakkuk, and Zephaniah, Haggai, then Zechariah, and Malachi. All these are one. The second is of Isaiah. Then the one called as an infant, Jeremiah, Then Ezekiel, and the gift of Daniel. I count therefore, twenty-two of the ancient books, corresponding to the number of the Hebrew letters. Now count also those of the new mystery. Matthew wrote the miracles of Christ for the Hebrews, Mark for Italy, Luke for Greece; John for all, the great herald, who walked in the heavens. Then the acts of the wise apostles. Of Paul there are fourteen epistles. And the seven catholic, [which include] one of James, two of Peter, three of John also; and Jude is the seventh. You have them all. And if there are any beyond these, they are not genuine.

                            <h5 class="pt-2">Jerome - Preface to the Books of the Kings (390 AD)</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                And so there are also twenty-two books of the Old Law; that is, five of Moses, eight of the prophets, nine of the Hagiographa, though some include Ruth and Kinoth (Lamentations) amongst the Hagiographa, and think that these books ought to be reckoned separately; we should thus have twenty-four books of the ancient Law. And these the Apocalypse of John represents by the twenty-four elders, who adore the Lamb and offer their crowns with lowered visage, while in their presence stand the four living creatures with eyes before and behind, that is, looking to the past and the future, and with unwearied voice crying, "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, who was and is and will be." <br> <br>
                                
                                This preface to the Scriptures may serve as a helmeted [i.e. defensive] introduction to all the books which we turn from Hebrew into Latin, so that we may be assured that what is outside of them must be placed aside among the Apocryphal writings. <b>Wisdom, therefore, which generally bears the name of Solomon, and the book of Jesus the Son of Sirach, and Judith, and Tobias, and the Shepherd are not in the canon.</b> The first book of Maccabees is found in Hebrew, but the second is Greek, as can be proved from the very style.

                                By the time of the captives' return from Babylon these Jews had acquired the following books and prophets, and the following books of the prophets: 1. Genesis. 2. Exodus. 3. Leviticus. 4. Numbers. 5. Deuteronomy. 6. The Book of Joshua the son of Nun. 7. The Book of the Judges. 8. Ruth. 9. Job. 10. The Psalter. 11. The Proverbs of Solomon. 12. Ecclesiastes. 13. The Song of Songs. 14. The First Book of Kings. 15. The Second Book of Kings. 16. The Third Book of Kings. 17. The Fourth Book of Kings. 1 18. The First Book of Chronicles. 19. The Second Book of Chronicles. 20. The Book of the Twelve Prophets. 21. The Prophet Isaiah. 22. The Prophet Jeremiah, with the Lamentations and the Epistles of Jeremiah and Baruch. 23. The Prophet Ezekiel. 24. The Prophet Daniel. 25. I Ezra. 26. II Ezra. 2 27. Esther. These are the twenty-seven books given the Jews by God. They are counted as twenty-two, however, like the letters of their Hebrew alphabet, because ten books which (Jews) reckon as five are double. But I have explained this clearly elsewhere. <b>And they have two more books of disputed canonicity, the Wisdom of Sirach and the Wisdom of Solomon,</b> apart from certain other apocrypha. All these sacred books taught (them) Judaism and Law's observances till the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

                                Observe, further, that there are two and twenty books of the Old Testament, one for each letter of the Hebrew tongue. For there are twenty-two letters of which five are double, and so they come to be twenty-seven. For the letters Caph, Mem, Nun, Pe, Sade are double. And thus the number of the books in this way is twenty-two, but is found to be twenty-seven because of the double character of five. For Ruth is joined on to Judges, and the Hebrews count them one book: the first and second books of Kings are counted one: and so are the third and fourth books of Kings: and also the first and second of Paraleipomena: and the first and second of Esdra. In this way, then, the books are collected together in four Pentateuchs and two others remain over, to form thus the canonical books. Five of them are of the Law, viz. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. This which is the code of the Law, constitutes the first Pentateuch. Then comes another Pentateuch, the so-called Grapheia, or as they are called by some, the Hagiographa, which are the following: Jesus the Son of Nave, Judges along with Ruth, first and second Kings, which are one book, third and fourth Kings, which are one book, and the two books of the Paraleipomena which are one book. This is the second Pentateuch. The third Pentateuch is the books in verse, viz. Job, Psalms, Proverbs of Solomon, Ecclesiastes of Solomon and the Song of Songs of Solomon. The fourth Pentateuch is the Prophetical books, viz the twelve prophets constituting one book, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel. Then come the two books of Esdra made into one, and Esther. <b>There bare also the Panaretus, that is the Wisdom of Solomon, and the Wisdom of Jesus, which was published in Hebrew by the father of Sirach, and afterwards translated into Greek by his grandson, Jesus, the Son of Sirach. These are virtuous and noble, but are not counted nor were they placed in the ark.</b>

                        The "five books of Solomon", according to Augustine, were Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and Ecclesiasticus. Above is repeated in Carthage (419 AD) Canon 24. Council of Hippo (393 AD) had said the same thing. No explicit mention of Baruch - assumed to be implicit in Jeremiah.
