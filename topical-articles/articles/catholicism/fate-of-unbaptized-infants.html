                        <p class="article-body">
                            The doctrine that infants who die in Original Sin alone go to Hell can be seen very early in Catholic history, such as in the cases of Pope Innocent I (401-417 AD), Pope Gelasius I (492-496 AD), and Pope Gregory I (540-604 AD), who taught such a thing explicitly:

                                Will infants after the end of their life, even if while they live they are not baptized in Christ, be in eternal life, or will they not? If he should say, "They will", how then did he answer that he had condemned what had been uttered under his name "according to the judgment of Innocent, of blessed memory"? <b>Lo, Pope Innocent, of blessed memory, says that infants have not life without Christ's baptism, and without partaking of Christ's body and blood.</b>

                                As for infants, who, according to this heresy, are said not to be condemned for original sin alone, such a proposition is both impious and profane. While every Christian knows that infants, fresh from their mothers' wombs, are baptized for the remission of sins, which the Catholic Church rightly celebrates, it is not done falsely, but truly. For this reason, because they have no personal sins, it is certain that only their original sins are forgiven. <b>Therefore, since all their sins are remitted through baptism, they attain eternal life; it follows that if their sins are not remitted, they cannot attain eternal life.</b> <br> <br>

                                <b>There is nothing they can say, such as that the unbaptized children can merely be excluded from the Kingdom of Heaven without eternal damnation.</b> Since without baptism they cannot eat the body or drink the blood of Christ, they cannot have life in themselves; therefore, without this life, they will inevitably be condemned to eternal death. Let them take away this so-called third place they have invented for deceiving the innocent, and since we only read of the right and the left, let them not leave the unbaptized on the left side, but allow those who are baptized to be transferred to the right through holy regeneration.

And these have one wound, viz. to be born in corruption, and another, to die in the flesh. But forasmuch as after death there also follows, death eternal, by a secret and righteous judgment 'wounds are multiplied to them without cause.' <b>For they even receive everlasting torments, who never sinned by their own will. And hence it is written, Even the infant of a single day is not pure in His sight upon earth.</b> Hence (Truth) says by His own lips, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

                            Notice, the teaching of the Ecumenical Council is extremely clear. The fate of the unbaptized who die in "original sin alone" is unambiguously stated to be Hell. Any proposed exception to this would simply be a rejection of what the council says, when it provides absolutely no room for caveats. And, how could a caveat exist? Are any infants "more deserving" of an exception, than others?

                            The doctrine that infants go to Hell, but to a part of it that is without fire, is reiterated by Pope Pius VI (1717-1799 AD):

Either way, the child is admittedly innocent, having "original sin" only. So, no exception is given, because the doctrine leaves no room for exceptions.

                            Notice above that Pius XII specifically mentions those who are "still unborn" as being subject to this danger, and in need of baptism, as did Pope Sixtus V in <i>Effraenatam</i>, who spoke of "fetuses still hiding in the maternal viscera" being excluded "from the blessed vision of God". This is due to the Church's doctrine that Original Sin is imbued upon a person at conception. Therefore, the Church teaches that not only newborns and infants, but even the <i>unborn</i> go to Limbo. This necessarily means that there are tens of billions of unborn infants in Limbo, as only about 30% of fertilized eggs will result in a live birth. So, for every human ever born, 2 or 3 went straight to Limbo, having perished before being brought to term.

This study was completed under the pontificate of Pope Benedict XVI (1927-2022 AD), and the Pope approved the document submitted by the commission on January 19, 2007.

That is perfectly, unambiguously clear. As were Pope Innocent I, Pope Gelasius I, Pope Gregory I, Pope Pius VI, Pope Sixtus V, Pope Pius XII, and the Council of Trent.

Their attempt to square a theological circle requires them to start playing with language, and employing other deceptive, dishonest tactics. The Church was not silent on this issue, it was unambiguous, and slammed the door on the "hope" that the modern Catholic Church professes, many hundreds of years ago.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            In the past, the Church clearly and repeatedly taught that infants who die without water baptism go to a section of Hell known as Limbo. It was a well-established, authentic tradition of the Church, taught in many different authoritative documents spanning hundreds of years. However, in modern times, the Church has denied that the fate of unbaptized infants is necessarily Limbo, but rather hopes that they too may go to Heaven. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Church's failure to dogmatically stand behind Limbo, even though Limbo was taught by an Ecumenical Council and multiple Popes, presents another modern contradiction of convenience for the Roman Catholic Church. These are such that come about by the Church wanting to distance itself from doctrines that it definitely held and taught in the past, because such doctrines are horrific to modern sensibilities. See, for instance, <a href="../catholicism/the-death-penalty.html" target="_blank">the death penalty</a>, <a href="../catholicism/homosexuality.html" target="_blank">criminalizing homosexuality</a>, <a href="../catholicism/altar-girls.html" target="_blank">banning female altar servers</a>, <a href="../catholicism/torturing-heretics-and-the-inquisition.html" target="_blank">torturing heretics</a>, <a href="../catholicism/treatment-of-the-jews.html" target="_blank">confining Jews to ghettos</a>, etc.

                            Finally, please note that this article has been purposely limited in scope to only the fate of unbaptized infants. When discussing non-infants, there are many provisions within modern Roman Catholicism for unbaptized people to be saved, under the auspices of "baptism of desire" or "baptism of blood". This is part of how the modern Catholic Church's <a href="../catholicism/there-is-no-salvation-outside-the-catholic-church.html" target="_blank">contradictory teaching on what constitutes the "Church"</a> is justified, even though such doctrines were also historically rejected unambiguously by the Church.

                                Concupiscence, therefore, as the law of sin which remains in the members of this body of death, is born with infants. In baptized infants, it is deprived of guilt, is left for the struggle [of life], but pursues with no condemnation, such as die before the struggle. <b>Unbaptized infants it implicates as guilty and as children of wrath, even if they die in infancy, draws into condemnation.</b>

                                    1250 Born with a fallen human nature and tainted by original sin, children also have need of the new birth in Baptism to be freed from the power of darkness and brought into the realm of the freedom of the children of God, to which all men are called. The sheer gratuitousness of the grace of salvation is particularly manifest in infant Baptism. The Church and the parents would deny a child the priceless grace of becoming a child of God were they not to confer Baptism shortly after birth.
