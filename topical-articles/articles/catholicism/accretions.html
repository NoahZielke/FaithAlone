                            The fundamental reason for the vast gulf between Biblical Christianity and Roman Catholicism is our respective authorities:  
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Biblical Christianity teaches that inspired Scripture is the sole infallible rule of faith (2 Timothy 3:16-17). Not the only rule of faith - as is sometimes erroneously alleged - the only <i>infallible</i> rule of faith </li>
                            <li>Roman Catholicism teaches that the Roman Catholic Church's judgment of Scripture and Tradition is the sole infallible rule of faith </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This Roman Catholic (and to a lesser, more disorganized degree, Eastern Orthodox) doctrine of Sola Ecclesia has led to many developments (accretions) in their religion, which no one reading the Bible, and practicing any meaningful form of exegesis, would ever get from the text.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            With Biblical doctrine, one must show a chapter and verse in inspired Scripture that clearly states what they are trying to prove, in context. Allusion isn't good enough. Symbology is not good enough. We build our theology on clear statements, from what we know is God-breathed. That is how we avoid accretions, and heresy. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In contrast, the case for these Roman Catholic doctrines is established on taking a verse of Scripture, which does not at all, in context, state their doctrine, or anything like their doctrine, and then immediately running to the traditions of non-inspired people from centuries after the Apostles, and selectively citing what they said, in order to arrive at the fully fleshed-out Roman Catholic doctrine. Sometimes, a verse of Scripture is not even appealed to, but rather Tradition alone. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            To justify this practice, Catholics insist that the corpus of traditions which they maintain are directly from the Apostles themselves, and therefore, represent authoritative elements of the faith outside of Scripture. The two major flaws with these assertions are:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Not everything an Apostle did or taught was correct, or inspired (Galatians 2:11-14, Acts 16:1-3)</li> <!--21:4-14-->
                            <li>No direct Apostolic link can be established for any of these dogmas</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            One of the first instances in the history of the Christian Church of someone claiming to have a direct Apostolic basis for a doctrine is Irenaeus (130-202 AD), in his work <i>Against Heresies</i>, <a href="../catholicism/rejecting-the-early-church.html" target="_blank">stating that Jesus was over 40 years old when He died</a>. No one on earth believes that today. Everyone agrees that he was teaching false doctrine. And, he is one of the earliest Christian writers. "An Apostle told me", isn't good enough. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Further, Roman Catholics freely disregard claimed Apostolic tradition if it doesn't agree with what they already believe. They agree with Pope Victor I (189-199 AD) in his attempt to force the entire Church to celebrate Passover on a single day (in direct violation of Romans 14:4-6), even though a bishop named Polycrates (130-196 AD) cited an Apostolic tradition from the Apostles Philip and John for the day on which he celebrated Passover, when rejecting Victor's judgment (Eusebius - Ecclesiastical History, Book 5, Chapter 24). Do Roman Catholics care? No, they do not, instead siding with Victor against the Apostolic tradition, and the Bible. <!--Additionally, they freely reject the doctrine of those who knew the Apostles, as Papias (60-130 AD) - who according to Irenaeus, knew the Apostle John - believed in a literal millennial reign of Jesus after the resurrection on the basis of "unwritten tradition" (Eusebius - Ecclesiastical History, Book 3, Chapter 39) - a position which is rejected by Catholics. The Apostle John wrote the book that describes the Millennium (Revelation 20:1-6). His companion taught Premillennialism. Do Roman Catholics care? No, they do not. (Commented because in chapter 39, Eusebius doubts whether Papias knew John, but instead those who knew the Apostles, such as another presbyter John)-->
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            And, not even the most basic questions about any of these supposedly Apostolic traditions which Roman Catholics wish to bind to people's consciences can be answered, such as - which Apostle? Who did he tell it to? When did he say it? Where was he? Is the person who he supposedly told it to reliable? Is each person in the chain of transmitters after him reliable? Is the manuscript tradition of the relevant sources robust enough to bind them on the conscience of all Christians? These basic questions, whose answers should be forthcoming if the tradition was legitimate, and binding on the souls of all Christians, cannot be answered for even a single one of any of these traditions.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Therefore, when reading Church history, the writers are to be subject to the same scrutiny that writers today are subject to, namely, "Where in Scripture did they get that from?". Age isn't good enough. There were people teaching lies, and creating false doctrine, <i>while the New Testament itself was being written</i> (John 21:21-23, Acts 15:23-24, 20:28-31: 2 Corinthians 2:17, Galatians 1:6-7: 2 Peter 3:16, Revelation 2:15). "We all believe it", isn't good enough. Those who are concerned with the truth should require <i>inspired</i> proof for anything that anyone tries to bind to their (and their family's) conscience.
                        </p>
                        <!-- <p class="article-body">
                            In other cases, Roman Catholics admit that there has been a development of doctrine, but because of Sola Ecclesia, they trust that the development is legitimate, and so imagine that they avoid the charge of Matthew 15:1-9 (originally a comment, Mark 7:1-13) given against the Pharisees. However, adding the development option leads to the following method for justifying a doctrine:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>If the doctrine can be found in some form by the 4-6th century, it is asserted, with or without any attempt at documentary evidence, that it goes back to the Apostles</li>
                            <li>If the doctrine cannot be found, or is even contradicted by early Christian writers, it is nonetheless asserted to be a legitimate development of doctrine, and must be obeyed on the authority of the Magisterium regardless</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            So, even though selections from historical Christian writings are sometimes useful for the Roman Catholic Church, ultimately, they are not required. Sola Ecclesia results in nothing needing to be proven or documented historically at all.

In his book, Fontana noted the cost (46,800,052 ducats). Worried that the mention of such a huge price tag would provoke more criticism from the Protestants, the pope suspended publication. The book was issued in 1694 by Innocent XII." (R.A. Scotti - <i>Basilica</i>, Chapter 28)</li>

Therefore, says a certain writer, if the evangelist affirms that Mary brought forth her first-born, is it to be supposed that she afterwards had other children? But the same author adds that if it is of faith that Mary had no other children according to the flesh except Jesus, then she must have other spiritual children, and these we are. <br> <br>

And God explained it to her by telling her that Jesus was her first-born according to the flesh, but men were her second-born according to the spirit.

                            Briefly, it should be noted that there is uncertainty and controversy over the text of Ecumenical Councils, with missing or incomplete acts, textual variants, or variants between Greek and Latin copies, for instance. Additionally, it should not have to be mentioned that historically these texts were not available for the average Christian, in their own language, yet, Roman Catholics hold that at least portions of them are inspired by the Holy Spirit.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            When these considerations are extended to local councils, and the writings of individual early Christians, the problem explodes in complexity and controversy. Entire works are forged, and written in the names of popular preachers, leading later writers to mistakenly cite them as authentic, and some works survive only in translation, or otherwise have a dubious manuscript history. Infamous forgeries like the Donation of Constantine, and the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals have impacted world history, because of their acceptance and use by the Papacy.

                            This consideration is highlighted to emphasize that not only is "tradition" a very nebulous category, subject to the whims of whoever is claiming to define it, but the texts that constitute "tradition" are often contested, and very often, unread by more than 99% of Christians at any given time, especially historically, being locked away from most of them by impediments such as availability, and language barriers.

                                    16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: <br>
                                    17 That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.

                            This passage establishes a classification. That which is God-breathed is that which equips a man for all the good works that God wants him to do, regardless of what that happens to be at the time. So, as in Ecclesiastes 12:13, it is not saying that "the whole duty of man is to keep only what has been revealed up to this point, and that will never change". Rather, he is saying that, at any point in time, the whole duty of man is to obey only what God commands. 

                            So, God holds us accountable for that which is God-breathed, and it is our guide unto all good, which is why God inspired it. Take for instance, if only Matthew was revealed. What does that mean for 2 Timothy? Does it mean that it is superfluous, since we are already equipped for "every good work" by Matthew alone? No, rather if only Matthew was revealed, we would have the Old Testament, plus Matthew, as our class of "Scripture", which is God's revealed truth to us. We are responsible to obey solely what is there, and use what is there as a criteria by which to judge everything else. Sin is not imputed where there is no Law. When 2 Timothy is revealed, we still have our classification of that which is God-breathed, however, we now have more that is binding to us. More express, infallible guidance, from the very mouth of God, which we will be held accountable for. We still have our two classifications - that which is God-breathed, and that which isn't. We are to appeal only to that which is God breathed for dogmatic, binding, supernatural guidance, because only that is guaranteed to be infallible.

                            Before Scripture, the only God-given guidance was in the form of direct communication, and a conscience. With the advent of written revelation, God holds man accountable for what is written (Matthew 22:31, etc.).

                            Roman Catholics will appeal to a corpus of Apostolic tradition, yet cannot document it historically. One is instead expected to trust them, and their claims that the Apostles taught that we must venerate icons to be saved (Nicaea II, 787 AD), that Mary was bodily assumed to Heaven (Munificentissimus Deus, 1950 AD), that every Christian on earth must defer to the Bishop of Rome on matters of doctrine (Vatican 1, 1870 AD), and so on. Of course, since the Apostles never taught these things to anyone, they are absent from both the Bible, and the early Christian writings. Yet, these late accretions are asserted to be "Apostolic tradition", because Rome says so, and in their own mind, that is supposed to be meaningful. It doesn't matter what the Bible says, and it really doesn't matter what early Christians said. It is merely taken as a presupposition that the Roman Catholic Church is correct, then the Bible and history are twisted and bent until they agree.
