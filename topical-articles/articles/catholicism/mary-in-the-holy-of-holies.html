                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Orthodox belief that Mary not only lived in the Temple in Jerusalem, but in the Holy of Holies itself, is commonly attributed to the second century text <i>The Protoevangelium of James</i>. It is known that this apocryphal text is early, because Origen (185-253 AD) refers to some version of it (Origen, Commentary on Matthew, Book 10, Chapter 17). <!-- https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/101610.htm -->
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This text teaches that Mary was brought to the Second Temple in Jerusalem by her parents at age 3, and then lived inside the Temple - specifically in the Holy of Holies - and was fed by angels, until she was 12 years old:

What should we do about her so that she won't pollute the sanctuary of the Lord our God?" And they said to the chief priest, "You stand at the altar of the Lord. Go in and pray about her, and if the Lord God reveals anything to you, we'll do it." <br> <br>

And whomever the Lord God points out with a sign, she'll be his wife."

                            The Protoevangelium of James is not regarded as orthodox or canonical by the Orthodox Church, and so citing the above is not an attempt to ascribe this text to them. Rather, it is only mentioned here because it is probably the source of what they believe about Mary, which will be established in the next section from canonical Orthodox sources.

                            This is significant, because unlike the Roman Catholic Church, which is fond of more organized confessions of what they believe, the Orthodox will point those who would learn about their beliefs to their <i>liturgy</i>. A belief making its way into Orthodox liturgy is a canonical endorsement of that belief, by the Orthodox Church.

                                In Her manner She showed that She was not so much presented into the Temple, but that She Herself entered into the service of God of her own accord, as if she had wings, striving towards this sacred and divine love.

                                A vow was given by those who marvelously begot her to return her that was given to the Giver; so accordingly the Mother of God strangely changed her dwelling from the house of her father to the house of God while still an infant. <b>She passed not a few years in the Holy of Holies itself, wherein under the care of an angel she enjoyed ineffable nourishment such as even Adam did not succeed in tasting;</b> for indeed if he had, like this immaculate one, he would not have fallen away from life, even though it was because of Adam and so that she might prove to be his daughter, that she yielded a little to nature, as did her Son, Who has now ascended from earth into heaven. <br><br>

                                If, therefore, her soul, which was an abode of God's grace, ascended into Heaven when bereaved of things here below, a thing which is abundantly evident, how could it be that the body which not only received in itself the pre-eternal and only-begotten Son of God, the ever-flowing Wellspring of grace, but also manifested His Body by way of birth, should not have also been taken up into Heaven? Or, if while yet three years of age and not yet possessing that super-celestial in-dwelling, she seemed not to bear our flesh <b>as she abode in the Holy of Holies,</b> and after she became supremely perfect even as regards her body by such great marvels, how indeed could that body suffer corruption and turn to earth?

                            In the Bible, the Holy of Holies was the place in the Tabernacle/Temple that housed the Ark of the Covenant (Exodus 26:33-34). The High Priest would make an offering there once per year, on the Day of Atonement (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus%2016&version=KJV" target="_blank">Leviticus 16</a>):

                            In light of the above, the idea that the High Priest would let (or be allowed to let) a 3 year-old Mary live <i>inside</i> the Holy of Holies, is a joke. It is laughable, both historically, and Biblically, that anyone would ever be allowed to live <i>inside</i> the Most Holy Place.

                                The rich symbolism of the Temple for spiritual life and theological understanding was one important reason why the festival was enshrined in Church tradition on the sole basis of apocryphal accounts of Mary's life such as the Book of James. This was in spite of the patent impossibility of its premise that a girl could be kept in the Temple of Jerusalem along with some companions (as though they were Vestal virgins in a Roman temple), let alone be admitted into the Holy of Holies where the High Priest alone could go once a year on Yom Kippur with fear and trembling.

                            It would seem that whoever composed the narrative about Mary in the Temple was utterly disconnected from, and ignorant of, first century Jewish beliefs about the Temple, and women more generally, not to mention the Most Holy Place's status in the Old Testament.

                            Additionally, one would expect to see some trace of Mary's miraculous, sanctified childhood evidenced somewhere in the Gospel accounts of her, if this narrative about her early life were true. Instead, we see things like:

                            When the angel greets Mary with "Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women", she is confused, and wonders why the angel greets her in the way that he does. This is not the kind of reaction we would expect from someone who had been raised in the Holy of Holies, and fed with food from Heaven, by angels.

                            Notice what is happening above. Those familiar with Jesus's family use the ordinariness of his mother and father as an alibi to reject Him. This is not what one would expect to see, if Mary had been a consecrated baby, allowed to live in the Temple in Jerusalem for many years, under the care of the High Priest, and ministry of the angels. If Mary had actually been in the Temple in the manner believed by the Orthodox, one would expect her to be one of the most well-known people in the nation of Israel.

                            We would expect a contemporary Jewish historian, like Josephus (37-100 AD), to record that a young girl was allowed to live in the Holy of Holies for almost a decade.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            The belief that Mary was somehow consecrated from birth, or lived in the Temple in Jerusalem, is an example of a belief that has no Biblical or historical support, but rather had its origin in heretical, forged Scripture, and was accepted into sects of Christianity, like the Eastern Orthodox Church, that had misplaced emphasis and fixation on Mary, virginity, and asceticism.
