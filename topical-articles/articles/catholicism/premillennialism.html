                        <h3>Premillennialism</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            There are three main positions in the study of Eschatology regarding the millennium described in Revelation 20:1-6:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Premillennialism (Chiliasm) - The millennial reign of Jesus Christ will occur after His second coming, and will be a physical reign with Jesus actually on earth, ruling the entire world, for at least 1,000 years </li>
                            <li>Postmillennialism - The millennial reign of Jesus Christ is symbolic of a golden age of Christianization of the world, during which Christ "rules" through the Church. After this millennium, Jesus Christ's Second Coming will occur </li>
                            <li>Amillennialism - The millennial reign of Jesus Christ is active right now, and has been active ever since Jesus ascended to Heaven. The Second Coming of Christ will occur suddenly and unexpectedly </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            While this article is not intended to cover the case for Premillennialism in great detail, the reasons it is compelling are:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>It places Revelation 20 after Revelation 19, as one would expect when simply reading the book of Revelation. The Second Coming of Jesus Christ to earth is clearly described in Revelation 19:11-21, and the millennium is described <i>immediately following</i> that passage, in Revelation 20:1-6</li>
                            <li>Revelation 20:1-3 mentions an angel take Satan, and cast him "into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more". A few observations:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The world still <i>seems</i> very much deceived by Satan. Islam started long after the ascension of Jesus Christ. Many billions of people reject Christianity, and many governments persecute Christians, and have done so historically as well, on a consistent basis. Injustice and wickedness abound on earth. It does not <i>seem</i> as if the Devil is bound, and Jesus Christ is ruling the earth (Revelation 20:4-6)</li>
                                    <li>Long after the ascension of Jesus, the Apostle Peter instructs believers to "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, <i>walketh about,</i> seeking whom he may devour" (1 Peter 5:8)</li>
                                    <li>The Devil is likewise described, long after the ascension of Jesus, as "the god of this world" blinding the minds of the lost (2 Corinthians 4:3-4). 1 John 5:19, in many translations, reads "the whole world lies in the power of the evil one". Likewise, believers are told that "we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places" (Ephesians 6:12)</li>
                                    <li>Believers are warned about the Devil's influence many times in the New Testament, after the ascension - Ephesians 4:27, 6:11: 1 Timothy 3:6-7: 2 Timothy 2:26, James 4:7, Revelation 2:10, etc. </li>
                                    <!-- 1 Corinthians 5:5 -->
                                </ul>
                                Therefore, it would seem that the Devil is not bound, and that Amillennialism in particular is untenable
                            </li>
                            <li>Revelation 20:5-6 mentions a "resurrection" of a group including those who "were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years" (Revelation 20:4). This means that these people had already gone through all the events described in Revelation with the Antichrist, had been killed, and then rose from the dead. 1 Corinthians 15:21-23 indicates that this resurrection takes place at the Second Coming of Christ, and is a <i>bodily</i> resurrection, as it uses Christ as the prototype, and His was a bodily resurrection. Also, 2 Timothy 2:18 and Acts 2:29 indicate that this resurrection has not happened yet</li>
                            <li>Daniel 7:13-14 describes Jesus coming "with the clouds of heaven", and <i>then</i> it says "there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him". In Matthew 24:26-30, Jesus says that when He comes "in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory", the entire world is going to see Him (Matthew 24:26-27), and "all the tribes of the earth" (Matthew 24:30). Therefore, the Millennium is after the Second Coming, which will be seen by the whole world, and this Second Coming has not happened yet</li>
                            <!-- Note that this would require a very symbolic (and in places, very hyperbolic) view of many passages in Revelation, Daniel 7, Isaiah 65 -->
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Therefore, Premillennialism is a compelling position, as it seems to be the most faithful and sensible interpretation of Revelation chapters 19 and 20, especially in light of what the rest of Scripture says about the Second Coming and the Devil, and when looking at the world's persecution of Christians, and the prevalence of wickedness, and false religion.

                        <h3>The Catholic and Orthodox Views of Premillennialism</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Beginning with Catholicism, the Catholic Church has approached a condemnation of the Premillennial view, but rather than outright declaring it false, or heretical, merely say that it "cannot be taught safely":
                        </p>

                            <h5 class="pt-2">Decree of the Holy Office, July 21, 1944</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                2296 In recent times on several occasions this Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office has been asked what must be thought of the system of mitigated Millenarianism, which teaches, for example, that Christ the Lord before the final judgment, whether or not preceded by the resurrection of the many just, will come visibly to rule over this world. <br> <br>

                                The answer is: The system of mitigated Millenarianism cannot be taught safely.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The above's description of the doctrine which teaches that "Christ the Lord before the final judgment, whether or not preceded by the resurrection of the many just, will come visibly to rule over this world", encompasses the common form of Premillennialism held by many today, as it certainly teaches that Jesus will come to visibly rule over the world prior to the final judgment. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            So, Catholicism is not favorable to the Premillennial view. Rather, it actively teaches Amillennialism, as can be demonstrated by looking at the Catechism, which teaches that Jesus Christ's kingdom was inaugurated after the Lord's ascension to Heaven, when He sat down at the right hand of the Father:
                        </p>

                                664 Being seated at the Father's right hand signifies the inauguration of the Messiah's kingdom, the fulfilment of the prophet Daniel's vision concerning the Son of man: "To him was given dominion and glory and kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed." After this event the apostles became witnesses of the "kingdom [that] will have no end".
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Similarly, the Catholic Study Bible's note on Revelation 20:1-6 reads:
                        </p>

                                Like the other numerical values in this book, the thousand years are not to be taken literally; they symbolize the long period of time between the chaining up of Satan (a symbol for Christ's resurrection-victory over death and the forces of evil) and the end of the world. During this time God's people share in the glorious reign of God that is present to them by virtue of their baptismal victory over death and sin;

                        <p class="article-body">
                            Therefore, Catholicism holds a view of the Millennium that teaches that Jesus will not literally reign here on earth, but rather began to spiritually reign from Heaven, just after He rose from the dead, and ascended to Heaven. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Orthodoxy, likewise, teaches Amillennialism, and rejects Premillennialism:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Orthodox Study Bible - Revelation 20:2</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                Though most did not, a few early Fathers and writers believed in a literal thousand year binding of Satan and reign of Christ and the saints on earth (vv. 2-7). The Church, however, authoritatively rejected this teaching (called <i>chiliasm</i>) at the Second Ecumenical Council. In apocalyptic literature, numbers have symbolic significance. "Thousand" is often used in the Scriptures to denote a long period of time, a great quantity, completion, perfection, thoroughness (Job 9:3: 2 Pt 3:8). Here, a thousand years (vv. 2-7) is interpreted as the Church age, when Jesus reigns on earth in those who believe. It is that era between the first and second comings of Christ, also called the "last times," when Satan's effectiveness at deceit is restricted through the Cross and Resurrection of Christ, and the saints share in Christ's earthly reign through the Church. For these persecuted Christians threatened by martyrdom, this is a consoling hope.

                            The above acknowledges that "a few early Fathers and writers believed in a literal thousand year binding of Satan and reign of Christ and the saints on earth", though asserts that "most did not". To the contrary, as will be shown later in this article, prior to 200 AD, it was the <i>majority</i> view of the extant writers from that period who speak on the subject.

                            The Orthodox Study Bible also suggested that the First Council of Constantinople's (381 AD) addition of the line "His kingdom will have no end" (Luke 1:33) to the Nicene Creed is a condemnation of Premillennialism. However, the addition being referred to is not a condemnation of Premillennialism, as Premillennialism does not teach that Jesus Christ's kingdom "ends". After the Millennium, Jesus destroys the last rebellion of mankind (Revelation 20:7-9), and then gives the kingdom over to God the Father, and the eternal state begins (1 Corinthians 15:24-28). So, Jesus Christ's kingdom is truly everlasting, as He rules forever, alongside God the Father, beginning at the Millennium, and continuing forever afterwards.

                            Historically, also, this has not been seen as a condemnation of Premillennialism. Philip Schaff (1819-1893 AD), commenting on the addition, notes:

                            Therefore, the study note in the Orthodox Study Bible is inaccurate on this point. Premillennialism was not condemned by an early Ecumenical Council. It is also wrong in stating that "most" early writers did not believe in Premillennialism.

                                In light of the substantial absence of Melito's writings, the assumption of his premillennial views is usually based on the fact that "Jerome [<i>Comm. on Ezek.</i> 36] and Gennadius [<i>De Dogm. Eccl.</i> 52] both affirm that he was a <i>decided millenarian</i>." (Shimeall, <i>Second Coming</i>, 67) <br> <br>

                                Without direct statements from Melito himself it is unwise to be dogmatic on the subject. But the existing testimony, especially when given by one like Jerome - himself no friend of millenarians - cannot be minimized. This testimony plus Melito's proximity in time and place to men whose premillennial "orthodoxy" cannot be questioned seems to task with the greater burden of proof those who would deny him the belief.

And God brought to a conclusion upon the sixth day the works that He had made; and God rested upon the seventh day from all His works." This is an account of the things formerly created, as also it is a prophecy of what is to come. For the day of the Lord is as a thousand years; and in six days created things were completed: it is evident, therefore, that they will come to an end at the sixth thousand year.

"For, behold," says Isaiah, "the day of the LORD cometh past remedy, full of fury and wrath, to lay waste the city of the earth, and to root sinners out of it." And again he says, "Let him be taken away, that he behold not the glory of God." And when these things are done, he says, "God will remove men far away, and those that are left shall multiply in the earth." "And they shall build houses, and shall inhabit them themselves: and plant vineyards, and eat of them themselves." For all these and other words were unquestionably spoken in reference to the resurrection of the just, which takes place after the coming of Antichrist, and the destruction of all nations under his rule; in [the times of] which [resurrection] the righteous shall reign in the earth, waxing stronger by the sight of the Lord: and through Him they shall become accustomed to partake in the glory of God the Father, and shall enjoy in the kingdom intercourse and communion with the holy angels, and union with spiritual beings; and [with respect to] those whom the Lord shall find in the flesh, awaiting Him from heaven, and who have suffered tribulation, as well as escaped the hands of the Wicked one. <br><br>

But in the times of the kingdom, the earth has been called again by Christ [to its pristine condition], and Jerusalem rebuilt after the pattern of the Jerusalem above, of which the prophet Isaiah says, "Behold, I have depicted thy walls upon my hands, and thou art always in my sight," And the apostle, too, writing to the Galatians, says in like manner, "But the Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all." He does not say this with any thought of an erratic AEon, or of any other power which departed from the Pleroma, or of Prunicus, but of the Jerusalem which has been delineated on [God's] hands. And in the Apocalypse John saw this new [Jerusalem] descending upon the new earth. For after the times of the kingdom, he says, "I saw a great white throne, and Him who sat upon it, from whose face the earth fled away, and the heavens; and there was no more place for them."

                                3 For, "the time approached," that is, all at once the time was fulfilled and the saints possessed the kingdom, when the Judge of judges and the King of kings in the future comes from heaven, who shall remove every chief and power which opposes him, and shall consume all in an eternal fire, punishing the unrighteous, but he shall give to his slaves both prophets and martyrs and to all who fear him the eternal kingdom.

In this way also whenever you see all these things happen, know that it is near the doors." <br>
                                7 And so while the abomination has not yet appeared, but while only the fourth beast still reigns, how is the manifestation of the Lord able to be?

                                4 And so it is absolutely necessary for six-thousand years to be fulfilled, so that the Sabbath rest may come, the holy day, in which God rested from all his works which he began to do. <br>
                                5 The Sabbath is a model and an image of the coming kingdom of the saints, when the saints shall co-reign with Christ, when he arrives from heaven, as also John in his Apocalypse describes. For a day of the Lord is as a thousand years. <br>
                                6 And so since in six days God made all things, it is necessary for six thousand years to be fulfilled. For they are not yet fulfilled, as John says, "Five have fallen, but one is," such is the sixth millennium, "the other has not yet come," saying "the other" he describes the seventh millennium in which there shall be rest.

And being attacked by enemies, they were banished from the city of Jerusalem, becoming a joy to all nations, so that the Gospel of the Lord may be preached in all the world and all time may be fulfilled and the end of the week may be encompassed and the two precursors of Christ may be dispatched and the abomination of desolation may be shown with them and the Judge of judges may be revealed from heaven and the resurrection of the saints and of all the world may occur and the eternal kingdom may be given to the saints and the unquenchable and sleepless fire of the impious may be inflamed.

                            Above, as others, Hippolytus relates the Millennium to the creation week, seeing earth as being on a 7,000-year plan, with 6,000 years followed by a 1,000 year Millennium. This detail is not what is being highlighted above - rather, the view that the Kingdom in which the saints will reign with Christ is still yet to come is the essence of Premillennialism, and it is clearly present here.

                            Historic Premillennialism has support Biblically, and in Church history. Unfortunately, it has been replaced with the doctrine of Amillennialism in the major Imperialist denominations, who often construe it as a novel doctrine, when it is not.

                                There is a joke in some seminarian circles in which the speaker (often a befuddled student prepping for an exam) decries premillennialism, postmillennialism, and amillennialism, asserting instead that he or she is a "panmillenialist, because it will all 'pan out' in the end." In the joke's theological favor, it does apprehend the ultimate sovereignty of God in salvation history: God will have his own way, regardless of how one exegetes Rev. 20:1-6.

                                669 As Lord, Christ is also head of the Church, which is his Body. Taken up to heaven and glorified after he had thus fully accomplished his mission, Christ dwells on earth in his Church. the redemption is the source of the authority that Christ, by virtue of the Holy Spirit, exercises over the Church. "The kingdom of Christ (is) already present in mystery", "on earth, the seed and the beginning of the kingdom". <br> <br>

                                670 Since the Ascension God's plan has entered into its fulfilment. We are already at "the last hour". "Already the final age of the world is with us, and the renewal of the world is irrevocably under way; it is even now anticipated in a certain real way, for the Church on earth is endowed already with a sanctity that is real but imperfect." Christ's kingdom already manifests its presence through the miraculous signs that attend its proclamation by the Church.... until all things are subjected to him. <br> <br>

                                671 Though already present in his Church, Christ's reign is nevertheless yet to be fulfilled "with power and great glory" by the King's return to earth. This reign is still under attack by the evil powers, even though they have been defeated definitively by Christ's Passover. Until everything is subject to him, "until there be realized new heavens and a new earth in which justice dwells, the pilgrim Church, in her sacraments and institutions, which belong to this present age, carries the mark of this world which will pass, and she herself takes her place among the creatures which groan and travail yet and await the revelation of the sons of God." That is why Christians pray, above all in the Eucharist, to hasten Christ's return by saying to him: Maranatha! "Our Lord, come!"
