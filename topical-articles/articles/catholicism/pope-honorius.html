                        <h3>Papal Dogmas</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            There are two distinct Roman Catholic doctrines pertaining to the authority of the Pope:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size:large">
                            <li>Papal Infallibility - Defined at the First Vatican Council (1870 AD), and teaches that the Pope is infallible when speaking Ex Cathedra on a matter of faith and morals</li>
                            <li>Papal Primacy - A general doctrine, applicable to the Pope at all times, in which he is the designated Vicar of Jesus Christ on earth, and the teacher of all Christians</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            For a definition of Papal Primacy, one can turn to the Ecumenical Council of Florence, and also a decree from Vatican 2:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Council of Florence (1439 AD) - Session 6</h5><!-- Quoted in Vatican 1 -->
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                6 We also define that the holy apostolic see and the Roman pontiff holds the primacy over the whole world, and the Roman pontiff is the successor of blessed Peter prince of the apostles, and that he is the true vicar of Christ, the head of the whole church, and the father and teacher of all Christians, and to him was committed in blessed Peter the full power of tending, ruling and governing the whole church, as is contained also in the acts of ecumenical councils and in the sacred canons.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Vatican 2 (1965 AD) - Lumen Gentium</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                <!-- But the college or body of bishops has no authority unless it is understood together with the Roman Pontiff, the successor of Peter as its head. The pope's power of primacy over all, both pastors and faithful, remains whole and intact. In virtue of his office, that is as Vicar of Christ and pastor of the whole Church, the Roman Pontiff has full, supreme and universal power over the Church. And he is always free to exercise this power. -->
                                25 This religious submission of mind and will must be shown in a special way to the authentic magisterium of the Roman Pontiff, even when he is not speaking ex cathedra; that is, it must be shown in such a way that his supreme magisterium is acknowledged with reverence, the judgments made by him are sincerely adhered to, according to his manifest mind and will. His mind and will in the matter may be known either from the character of the documents, from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his manner of speaking.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Notice above that the Pope is "the true vicar of Christ, the head of the whole church, and the father and teacher of all Christians", and "religious submission of mind and will must be shown in a special way to the authentic magisterium of the Roman Pontiff, even when he is not speaking ex cathedra".
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            It is easier to analyze the actions of a Pope from the perspective of Papal Primacy, because it applies generally to the Pope at any time, whereas Papal Infallibility is limited by Catholics to an <i>extremely</i> narrow set of circumstances, such that there is only a consensus around a handful of statements that have <i>ever</i> qualified as Ex Cathedra in the entire history of the Church. Therefore, this article will examine a Pope from the past in light of the doctrine of Papal Primacy. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Pope Honorius</h3> 
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Pope Honorius I (585-638 AD) was the Bishop of Rome from 625-638 AD. While he was Pope, he was asked for his judgment on the doctrine of Monoenergism - that Christ had one "energy" - by the Bishop of Constantinople, Sergius I (565-638 AD). In 635 AD, he responded that the doctrine that Christ had two energies, Dyoenergism, could lead to the mistaken belief that Christ had two wills. In doing so, he supported the doctrine of Monothelitism - that Christ only had one will. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This doctrine was later condemned as heretical, and the Monothelites were all anathematized in the Third Council of Constantinople - including Pope Honorius, by name:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Third Council of Constantinople (681 AD)</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                8 The holy council said: After we had reconsidered, according to our promise which we had made to your highness, the doctrinal letters of Sergius, at one time patriarch of this royal god-protected city to Cyrus, who was then bishop of Phasis and to Honorius some time Pope of Old Rome, as well as the letter of the latter to the same Sergius, we find that these documents are quite foreign to the apostolic dogmas, to the declarations of the holy Councils, and to all the accepted Fathers, and that they follow the false teachings of the heretics; therefore we entirely reject them, and execrate them as hurtful to the soul.
                                 <br> <br> 
                                But the names of those men whose doctrines we execrate must also be thrust forth from the holy Church of God, namely, that of Sergius some time bishop of this God-preserved royal city who was the first to write on this impious doctrine; also that of Cyrus of Alexandria, of Pyrrhus, Paul, and Peter, who died bishops of this God-preserved city, and were like-minded with them; and that of Theodore sometime bishop of Pharan, all of whom the most holy and thrice blessed Agatho, Pope of Old Rome, in his suggestion to our most pious and God-preserved lord and mighty Emperor, rejected, because they were minded contrary to our orthodox faith, <b>all of whom we define are to be subjected to anathema. And with these we define that there shall be expelled from the holy Church of God and anathematized Honorius who was some time Pope of Old Rome, because of what we found written by him to Sergius, that in all respects he followed his view and confirmed his impious doctrines.</b> <br> <br>

                                16 <b>To Honorius, the heretic, anathema!</b>

                                <!-- 18 But as (Satan) the author of evil, who, in the beginning, availed himself of the aid of the serpent, and by it brought the poison of death upon the human race, has not desisted, but in like manner now, having found suitable instruments for working out his will (we mean Theodorus, who was Bishop of Pharan, Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paul and Peter, who were Archbishops of this royal city, and moreover, Honorius who was Pope of the elder Rome, Cyrus Bishop of Alexandria, Macarius who was lately bishop of Antioch, and Stephen his disciple), has actively employed them in raising up for the whole Church the stumbling-blocks of one will and one operation in the two natures of Christ our true God, one of the Holy Trinity; thus disseminating, in novel terms, among the orthodox people, an heresy  -->
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Pope Agatho (577-681 AD), a successor of Honorius, wrote a letter to the Third Council of Constantinople, which some Roman Catholics attempt to construe as a defense of Honorius. However, in the letter, Pope Agatho never mentions Honorius, nor does he ask for a revision to the Acts of the Council which condemn Honorius. He merely affirms the doctrine of Dyothelitism.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Not only is there no evidence that Pope Agatho, or any other Pope, distributed a modified version of the Council's Acts with Honorius's condemnations removed, but the <i>response</i> of the Council to Pope Agatho explicitly mentioned that they had anathematized Honorius <i>again</i>, demonstrating that they saw nothing whatsoever in Agatho's letter contrary to that action - nor is there any subsequent letter from Agatho or his successors objecting:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Third Council of Constantinople (681 AD) - Letter of the Council to St. Agatho</h5>

                                And then tearing to pieces the foundations of their execrable heresy, and attacking them with spiritual and paternal arms, and confounding their tongues that they might not speak consistently with each other, <b>we overturned the tower built up by these followers of this most impious heresy; and we slew them with anathema, as lapsed concerning the faith and as sinners, in the morning outside the camp of the tabernacle of God,</b> that we may express ourselves after the manner of David, in accordance with the sentence already given concerning them in your letter, and their names are these: Theodore, bishop of Pharan, Sergius, <b>Honorius,</b> Cyrus, Paul, Pyrrhus and Peter. 
                                
                                <!-- Moreover, in addition to these, we justly subjected to the anathema of heretics those also who live in their impiety which they have received, or, to speak more accurately, in the impiety of these God-hated persons, Apollinaris, Severus and Themestius, to wit, Macarius, who was the bishop of the great city of Antioch (and him we also stripped deservedly of his pastor's robes on account of his impenitence concerning the orthodox faith and his obstinate stubbornness), and Stephen, his disciple in craziness and his teacher in impiety, also Polychronius, who was inveterate in his heretical doctrines, thus answering to his name; and finally all those who impenitently have taught or do teach, or now hold or have held similar doctrines. -->

                                But the most pious emperor [Constantine IV], inspired by the grace of the Holy Spirit and undertaking the job of his own free will on behalf of the purity of the Christian faith, has striven to purify the Catholic Church of God from the stain of heretical error with utmost effort, and he caused to be removed from the midst of the Church of God whatever offense could spring forth among Christian people. <b>And every inventory of a heretical statement who was condemned by the venerable council's judgment was thrown out of the union of the Catholic Church:</b> namely, Theodore, bishop of Pharan; Cyrus of Alexandria; Sergius, Paul, Pyrrhus, and Peter, former Patriarchs of Constantinople; <b>and together with them the Roman Honorius, who agreed that the immaculate rule of apostolic tradition which he received from his predecessor be contaminated;</b> but also Macarius of Antioch with his disciple Stephn (or rather his teacher in heretical wickedness); and a certain Polychronius, a crazy old man, a new Simon [Magus], who lately was promising to end his reliance on heretical preaching, but again becoming confused, did not wish to be converted to the path of true confession, [and] was punished with eternal condemnation.

                                <!-- Among these five venerable universal councils we also proclaim the holy Sixth universal council of one hundred and seventy-five venerable Presuls, which, favoring God, and graciously fulfilling the vows of the great memory of our great prince, Lord Constantine, was celebrated in the royal city, presided over by him, to whom the Apostolic memorial 40 Agatho Pope through He presided over his ambassadors and responsables, whose venerable tome he famously received, (0051A) those who endeavored to pollute the immaculate Church of God with a new and heretical dogma, and proved more manifestly wrong, and condemned them to perpetual anathema with their authors of error and supporters. -->

                                But the authors of the new heretical dogmas Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paulus, and Peter of Constantinople, together with Honorius, who pours fuel on their false assertions; and likewise both Theodore the Pharanite and Cyrus the Alexandrian, with their imitators, and at the same time those who persistently defended the heretical dogmas against the truth of the faith declared and preached by the Synod. <br><br>

                                Therefore, whomever or whatever the holy six universal councils rejected, we also strike down with a similar condemnation of the anathematized.

                            Therefore, according to the 6th, 7th, and 8th Ecumenical Councils above, and every Pope for a period of 3 centuries, the man who was Pope for a period of 13 years, was "expelled from the holy Church of God and anathematized", because he taught heresy in an official capacity, along with Sergius I of Constantinople. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This refutes the false doctrine of Papal Primacy. The Patriarch of Constantinople appealed to the Pope for guidance, and the Pope - "the true Vicar of Christ, the head of the whole church, and the father and teacher of all Christians" (Council of Florence, 1439 AD) - gave him a heretical opinion, and then he was anathematized repeatedly over the coming centuries. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            So, if Pope Honorius is "expelled from the holy Church of God and anathematized", who was the Vicar of Christ for the 13 years that he was Pope? Did Christ leave His flock without an infallible Vicar to lead them, for 13 years? How could the Chair of St. Peter be occupied by an anathematized heretic, for over a decade? 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In summary, the fact that Honorius was anathematized for heresy shows that the Pope is not trustworthy as a source of doctrine, because if any had followed him during the time of Honorius - or in the interim of 40 years between Honorius's death and the official condemnation of his letters - they would have been heretics, who would be anathematized by later councils.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            It also shows that the early Church did not believe in the modern Catholic Church's concepts of Papal Infallibility, or Papal Primacy in matters of faith and morals, which is why they showed no scruples in naming him, condemning him as a heretic, and anathematizing him, repeatedly, and as a result, leaving a 13-year gap in the Papacy. What happened to Honorius does not make sense if they viewed the Bishop of Rome as the Rock on which their religion was built.

                        <p class="article-body">
                            And lastly, it seemed this quotation from James White well summed up the illogical Catholic position on the Papacy, in spite of the inconvenient facts of history, like Honorius: 
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">James White - <a href="https://www.aomin.org/aoblog/roman-catholicism/failure-to-document-catholic-answers-glosses-over-history/" target="_blank">Failure to Document: Catholic Answers Glosses Over History</a></h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                The simple fact of the matter is that no one in the days of Honorius believed in "Papal Infallibility" as it is defined today.  In reality, no papal statement of the past is liable to be proven in error since it can always be argued that they "did not intend it to be a binding statement upon the entire church."  So, through the wonderful use of hindsight, any errant Papal teaching can be considered non-binding, and any Papal teaching that is still in vogue can be said to be consistent with the "universal faith of the Church."  It’s truly a wonderful system that actually means nothing at all, since you can never know if a current Pope’s teaching will get the stamp of approval of future generations, or will end up on the scrap-heap of "he didn’t mean that infallibly" pronouncements.

                            Anathema after death - Second Council of Constantinople (553 AD):
                            
                            Why ought we to add anything more? Anyone who wishes can consult the volumes of the heretical Theodore or the heretical chapters from his heretical books which have been included in our acts. Anyone can see his unbelievable folly and the disgraceful utterances made by him. We fear to continue and to rehearse again those shameful things. The writings of the holy fathers against him were also read out to us. We heard what had been written against his folly which was more than all the other heretics, and the historical records and imperial laws which set out his heresy from its beginning. Despite all this, those who defended his heresy, delighting in the insults offered by him to his creator, declared that it was improper to anathematize him after his death. Although we were aware of the ecclesiastical tradition concerning heretics, that they are anathematized even after death, we deemed it necessary to go into this matter as well and it can be found in the acts how several heretics were anathematized after they were dead. In many ways it has become clear to us that those who put forward this argument have no concern for God's judgments, nor for the pronouncements of the apostles, nor for the traditions of the fathers. We would willingly question them concerning what they would say about the Lord, who said of himself: He who believes in him is not condemned, he who does not believe in him is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God. And about that claim of the Apostle: Even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what you have received, let him be accursed. As we said earlier, I repeat once more: If anyone preaches to you a gospel contrary to what you have received, let him be accursed.

                            Since the Lord declares that the person is judged already, and the Apostle curses even the angels if they instruct in anything different from what we have preached, how is it possible even for the most presumptuous to assert that these condemnations apply only to those who are still alive? Are they unaware, or rather pretending to be unaware, that to be judged anathematized is just the same as to be separated from God? The heretic, even though he has not been condemned formally by any individual, in reality brings anathema on himself, having cut himself off from the way of truth by his heresy. What reply can such people make to the Apostle when he writes: As for someone who is factious, after admonishing him once or twice, have nothing more to do with him, knowing that such a person is perverted and sinful; he is self-condemned.
                        
                            (There is even more dealing with this if you continue)
