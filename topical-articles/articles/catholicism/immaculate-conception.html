                        <h3>Defining the Doctrine</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The Immaculate Conception of Mary was infallibly defined by Pope Pius IX (1792-1878 AD) as a dogma in his Encyclical Ineffabilis Deus:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Pope Pius IX - Ineffabilis Deus (1854 AD)</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                Wherefore, in humility and fasting, we unceasingly offered our private prayers as well as the public prayers of the Church to God the Father through his Son, that he would deign to direct and strengthen our mind by the power of the Holy Spirit. In like manner did we implore the help of the entire heavenly host as we ardently invoked the Paraclete. Accordingly, by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, for the honor of the Holy and undivided Trinity, for the glory and adornment of the Virgin Mother of God, for the exaltation of the Catholic Faith, and for the furtherance of the Catholic religion, by the authority of Jesus Christ our Lord, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by our own: <b>"We declare, pronounce, and define that the doctrine which holds that the most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instance of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the human race, was preserved free from all stain of original sin, is a doctrine revealed by God and therefore to be believed firmly and constantly by all the faithful."</b> <br> <br>
                                
                                <b>Hence, if anyone shall dare - which God forbid! - to think otherwise than as has been defined by us, let him know and understand that he is condemned by his own judgment; that he has suffered shipwreck in the faith; that he has separated from the unity of the Church;</b> and that, furthermore, by his own action he incurs the penalties established by law if he should dare to express in words or writing or by any other outward means the errors he thinks in his heart.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Above is universally recognized to be Ex Cathedra - the Pope employing the power, as would be defined by Vatican 1 (1870 AD), to infallibly define dogma, which must be believed by all the faithful on pain of Anathema. It teaches that if anyone does not believe that Mary was conceived without Original Sin, then they are "separated from the unity of the Church" - "outside of which there is absolutely no Salvation" (Fourth Lateran Council, 1215 AD). 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Biblical Evidence</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            There are many verses in the Bible stating that all have sinned (Romans 3:10-12, 3:23, 5:12, Psalm 14:2-3, Galatians 3:22, Ecclesiastes 7:20: 1 Kings 8:46). As far as exceptions are concerned, infants, and the mentally ill, are in a state of innocence regarding the sins that they may commit (Deuteronomy 1:39, Isaiah 7:16), and therefore, those sins are not imputed to them.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            There is no Biblical evidence, however, that Mary was somehow exempt from having had a sinful nature inherited from Adam, or even for the idea that she never committed actual sins. Biblically, Mary acknowledged that she needed a Savior in Luke 1:46-47. And, the angel had instructed her to name her baby "Jesus: for He shall save His people from their sins" (Matthew 1:21). There is no indication, anywhere in Scripture, that Mary was referring to some non-ordinary concept of Salvation from her personal sins, when she confessed that she had a "Savior".
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Additionally, in Luke 2:22-24, Mary goes to the Temple "to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons" (Luke 2:24). The Law said the following of this offering:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Leviticus 12:6-8</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                6 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and <b>a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering,</b> unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest: <br>
                                7 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female. <br>
                                8 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then <b>she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering:</b> and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            An unbiased reader, reading that Mary made a sin offering, would conclude that she was a sinner. If she had not been, notice that this would have represented a perfect opportunity for the Lord to have pointed that out in some way - either by a modified offering, or an explanation as to why she did not really need to offer the sin offering. But, that is totally absent. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            As for addressing Roman Catholic proof texts for this doctrine, see Chapter 13's discussion of Luke 1:28, 1:42, and Genesis 3:15 in <a href="../book-reviews/the-roman-catholic-controversy.html" target="_blank">my review of <i>The Roman Catholic Controversy</i>,</a> by James White. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            To summarize, there is no Biblical support whatsoever for Mary being sinless, let alone for her having been conceived without a sinful nature. And, there are many positive indications that she <i>was</i> a sinner, who needed a Savior, just as everyone else. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Church History</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            There are two categories of quotations from Church history that disprove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception:
                        </p>
                        <ol style="font-size:large">
                            <li>A statement that <i>all</i> except Christ sinned, or have sin, or that Christ alone is sinless</li>
                            <li>Explicit attribution of sin to Mary</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Because there are so many quotations for the first category, they will be relegated to <a href="#appendix-I">Appendix I</a>. This section will focus on the statements in which sins, or a sinful nature, are explicitly ascribed to Mary. 
                        </p>

                            Origen (185-253 AD), in his commentary on Luke 2:35, says the following:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Origen (185-253 AD) - Homilies on Luke 17:6-7</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                6 Thereupon Simeon says, "a sword will pierce your very soul". Which sword is this that pierce not only others' hearts, but even Mary's? Scripture clearly records that, at the time of the Passion, all the apostles were scandalized. The Lord himself said, "This night you will all be scandalized". Thus, they were all so scandalized that Peter too, the leader of the apostles, denied him three times. <b>Why do we think that the mother of the Lord was immune from scandal when the apostles were scandalized? If she did not suffer scandal at the Lord's Passion, then Jesus did not die for her sins. But, if "all have sinned and lack God's glory, but are justified by his grace and redeemed, then Mary too was scandalized at that time.</b> <br> <br>

                                7 And this is what Simeon now prophesies when he says, "And your very soul". You know, Mary, that you bore as a virgin, without a man. You heard from Gabriel, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you." <b>The "sword" of infidelity "will pierce" you, and you will be struck by the blade of uncertainty,</b> and you thoughts will tear you in pieces when you see him.

                            John Chrysostom (347-407 AD), a Saint and Doctor of the Church, in his commentary on Matthew 12:46-49, says the following:

                                And this is hence especially manifest. "For while He yet talked to the people", it is said, "one told Him, Your mother and Your brethren seek You". But He says, "who is my mother, and who are my brethren?" <br> <br>
                                
                                And this He said, not as being ashamed of His mother, nor denying her that bare Him; for if He had been ashamed of her, He would not have passed through that womb; but as declaring that she has no advantage from this, unless she do all that is required to be done. <b>For in fact that which she had essayed to do, was of superfluous vanity; in that she wanted to show the people that she has power and authority over her Son, imagining not as yet anything great concerning Him; whence also her unseasonable approach. See at all events both her self-confidence and theirs.</b> Since when they ought to have gone in, and listened with the multitude; or if they were not so minded, to have waited for His bringing His discourse to an end, and then to have come near; they call Him out, and do this before all, evincing a superfluous vanity, and wishing to make it appear, that with much authority they enjoin Him. And this too the evangelist shows that he is blaming, for with this very allusion did he thus express himself, While He yet talked to the people; as if he should say, What? Was there no other opportunity? Why, was it not possible to speak with Him in private?

                                This is the grace whereby it came to pass that God, Who came to take away sins, because sin was not in Him, was conceived and born a man in the similitude of sinful flesh. <b>The flesh of Mary, forsooth, which had been conceived in iniquities after the manner of men, was indeed sinful flesh,</b> which bore the Son of God in the similitude of sinful flesh.

                            <p class="mb-1">
                                6 And if it is permitted to say what the Church thinks, and the Church thinks that which is true, I say that she conceived by the Holy Spirit, but not that she was conceived by Him; that she was at once Mother and Virgin, but not that she was born of a virgin. Otherwise, where will be the prerogative of the Mother of the Lord, to have united in her person the glory of maternity and that of virginity, if you give the same glory to her mother also? This is not to honour the Virgin, but to detract from her honour. If, therefore, before her conception she could not possibly be sanctified, since she did not exist, nor in the conception itself, because of the sin which inhered in it, it remains to be believed that she received sanctification when existing in the womb after conception, which, by excluding sin, made her birth holy, but not her conception. <br> <br>

                                7 <b>Wherefore, although it has been given to some, though few, of the sons of men to be born with the gift of sanctity, yet to none has it been given to be conceived with it. So that to One alone should be reserved this privilege, to Him who should make all holy, and coming into the world, He alone, without sin should make an atonement for sinners.</b> The Lord Jesus, then, alone was conceived by the Holy Ghost, because He alone was holy before He was conceived. He being excepted, all the children of Adam are in the same case as he who confessed of himself with great humility and truth, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin hath my mother conceived me (Psalm 51:5). <br> <br>

                                8 And as this is so, what ground can there be for a Festival of the Conception of the Virgin? On what principle, I say, is either a conception asserted to be holy which is not by the Holy Ghost, not to say that it is by sin, or a festival be established which is in no wise holy? Willingly the glorious Virgin will be without this honour, by which either a sin seems to be honoured or a sanctity supposed which is not a fact. <b>And, besides, she will by no means be pleased by a presumptuous novelty against the custom of the Church,</b> a novelty which is the mother of rashness, the sister of superstition, the daughter of levity.

                            This article simply repeats the opinion of 14th century English Dominican Simon Bromyard who said that by “after” Aquinas meant a logical after and not a temporal one. But he was part of a tiny minority. The vast majority of Dominicans understood Aquinas as meaning after in a temporal way and thought that this interpretation was ridiculous as Aquinas clearly said “Hence we must believe that Mary was sanctified after the infusion of her soul.” In another place he says “immediately after”. Aquinas uses extremely precise language, “immediately after” means necessarily a temporal after and trying to understand that differently is slightly insulting to Aquinas.

                            The author of the article mentions Sent.III.D3.Q1.A2.qa2.Rep2 to prove that his interpretation is correct, but that’s a clear misunderstanding of a quote taken out of context. When Aquinas says that purification of the filth of corruption is not to be understood as the removal of anything existing, he is talking about St Ambrose quote who was talking about the annunciation as a second purification, not about Mary’s conception. Quite the contrary, he says in the previous sentence that Mary was purified from the filth of corruption, but that this filth is not any sin but the traces of original sin.

                            I would add that the opinion of virtually every Dominican about Aquinas meaning hasn’t changed, the difference is that nowadays they think he was wrong.

                            Thomas Aquinas (1224-1274 AD), a Saint and Doctor of the Church, likewise lived while this doctrine was being advocated for, and in his most important work, the Summa Theologica, he explicitly rejects it:

                                The sanctification of the Blessed Virgin cannot be understood as having taken place before animation, for two reasons. First, because the sanctification of which we are speaking, is nothing but the cleansing from original sin: for sanctification is a "perfect cleansing," as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. xii). Now sin cannot be taken away except by grace, the subject of which is the rational creature alone. Therefore before the infusion of the rational soul, the Blessed Virgin was not sanctified. <br> <br>
                                
                                Secondly, because, since the rational creature alone can be the subject of sin; before the infusion of the rational soul, the offspring conceived is not liable to sin. And thus, in whatever manner the Blessed Virgin would have been sanctified before animation, she could never have incurred the stain of original sin: and thus she would not have needed redemption and salvation which is by Christ, of whom it is written (Matthew 1:21): "He shall save His people from their sins." But this is unfitting, through implying that Christ is not the "Saviour of all men," as He is called (1 Timothy 4:10). It remains, therefore, that the Blessed Virgin was sanctified after animation.

                                Sanctification is twofold. One is that of the whole nature: inasmuch as the whole human nature is freed from all corruption of sin and punishment. This will take place at the resurrection. The other is personal sanctification. This is not transmitted to the children begotten of the flesh: because it does not regard the flesh but the mind. <b>Consequently, though the parents of the Blessed Virgin were cleansed from original sin, nevertheless she contracted original sin, since she was conceived by way of fleshly concupiscence and the intercourse of man and woman: for Augustine says (De Nup. et Concup. i): "All flesh born of carnal intercourse is sinful."</b>

                            The dogma of the Immaculate Conception, much like the <a href="../catholicism/assumption.html" target="_blank">Assumption of Mary</a>, is unbiblical, and ahistorical. Yet, the Catholic Church has bound it to the conscience of every professing Christian, on pain of anathema. This is a demonstration of the type of abuse that can take place when Sola Scriptura is abandoned in favor of Sola Ecclesia.

Rom 5:14) until the end, and condemnation would have remained indestructibly on all man, when by the condition of birth, there is one cause of perishing for all. <b>And so among the sons of men, the Lord Jesus alone was born innocent, since he alone was conceived without the pollution of carnal concupiscence.</b> He became a man of our race, so that we might be able to be partakers of the divine nature.
