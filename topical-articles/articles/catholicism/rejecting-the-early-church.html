                            Protestants can frequently agree with the early Church writers, where those writers agree with Scripture, and disagree with them where they depart from Scripture. This article demonstrates that those in Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy must be similarly selective, as none of them can affirm everything that the early Christian leaders taught, but rather only affirm what they teach so long as they view it in harmony with what their Imperialist denomination already teaches is orthodox.

He also mentions another miracle relating to Justus, surnamed Barsabas, how he swallowed a deadly poison, and received no harm, on account of the grace of the Lord. The same person, moreover, has set down other things as coming to him from <b>unwritten tradition,</b> amongst these some strange parables and instructions of the Saviour, and some other things of a more fabulous nature. <b>Amongst these he says that there will be a millennium after the resurrection from the dead, when the personal reign of Christ will be established on this earth.</b>

                                1 Let us consider the marvelous sign which is seen in the regions of the east, that is, in the parts about Arabia. <br>
                                2 There is a bird, which is named the phoenix. This, being the only one of its kind, liveth for five hundred years; and when it hath now reached the time of its dissolution that it should die, it maketh for itself a coffin of frankincense and myrrh and the other spices, into the which in the fullness of time it entereth, and so it dieth. <br>
                                3 But, as the flesh rotteth, a certain worm is engendered, which is nurtured from the moisture of the dead creature and putteth forth wings. Then, when it is grown lusty, it taketh up that coffin where are the bones of its parent, and carrying them journeyeth from the country of Arabia even unto Egypt, to the place called the City of the Sun (Heliopolis); <br>
                                4 And in the daytime in the sight of all, flying to the altar of the Sun, it layeth them thereupon; and this done, it setteth forth to return. <br>
                                5 So the priests examine the registers of the times, and they find that it hath come when the five hundredth year is completed. <br>
                                1 Do we then think it to be a great and marvelous thing, if the Creator of the universe shall bring about the resurrection of them that have served Him with holiness in the assurance of a good faith, seeing that He showeth to us even by a bird the magnificence of His promise?

                            <h5 class="pt-2">Irenaeus (130-202 AD) - Against Heresies, Book 2, Chapter 22</h5>

                                4 Being thirty years old when He came to be baptized, and then possessing the full age of a Master, He came to Jerusalem, so that He might be properly acknowledged by all as a Master. For He did not seem one thing while He was another, as those affirm who describe Him as being man only in appearance; but what He was, that He also appeared to be. Being a Master, therefore, He also possessed the age of a Master, not despising or evading any condition of humanity, nor setting aside in Himself that law which He had appointed for the human race, but sanctifying every age, by that period corresponding to it which belonged to Himself. For He came to save all through means of Himself-all, I say, who through Him are born again to God -infants, and children, and boys, and youths, and old men. He therefore passed through every age, becoming an infant for infants, thus sanctifying infants; a child for children, thus sanctifying those who are of this age, being at the same time made to them an example of piety, righteousness, and submission; a youth for youths, becoming an example to youths, and thus sanctifying them for the Lord. <b>So likewise He was an old man for old men,</b> that He might be a perfect Master for all, not merely as respects the setting forth of the truth, but also as regards age, sanctifying at the same time the aged also, and becoming an example to them likewise. Then, at last, He came on to death itself, that He might be "the first-born from the dead, that in all things He might have the pre-eminence," the Prince of life, existing before all, and going before all. <br> <br>

                                5 They, however, that they may establish their false opinion regarding that which is written, "to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord," maintain that He preached for one year only, and then suffered in the twelfth month. [In speaking thus], they are forgetful to their own disadvantage, destroying His whole work, and robbing Him of that age which is both more necessary and more honourable than any other; <b>that more advanced age, I mean, during which also as a teacher He excelled all others.</b> For how could He have had disciples, if He did not teach? And how could He have taught, unless He had reached the age of a Master? For when He came to be baptized, He had not yet completed His thirtieth year, but was beginning to be about thirty years of age (for thus Luke, who has mentioned His years, has expressed it: "Now Jesus was, as it were, beginning to be thirty years old," when He came to receive baptism); and, [according to these men,] He preached only one year reckoning from His baptism. On completing His thirtieth year He suffered, being in fact still a young man, and who had by no means attained to advanced age. Now, that the first stage of early life embraces thirty years, and that this extends onwards to the fortieth year, every one will admit; <b>but from the fortieth and fiftieth year a man begins to decline towards old age, which our Lord possessed while He still fulfilled the office of a Teacher, even as the Gospel and all the elders testify; those who were conversant in Asia with John, the disciple of the Lord, [affirming] that John conveyed to them that information. And he remained among them up to the times of Trajan. Some of them, moreover, saw not only John, but the other apostles also, and heard the very same account from them, and bear testimony as to the [validity of] the statement.</b> Whom then should we rather believe? Whether such men as these, or Ptolemaeus, who never saw the apostles, and who never even in his dreams attained to the slightest trace of an apostle? <br><br>

                                6 But, besides this, those very Jews who then disputed with the Lord Jesus Christ have most clearly indicated the same thing. For when the Lord said to them, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day; and he saw it, and was glad," they answered Him, "Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast Thou seen Abraham?" Now, such language is fittingly applied to one who has already passed the age of forty, without having as yet reached his fiftieth year, yet is not far from this latter period. But to one who is only thirty years old it would unquestionably be said, "Thou art not yet forty years old." For those who wished to convict Him of falsehood would certainly not extend the number of His years far beyond the age which they saw He had attained; but they mentioned a period near His real age, whether they had truly ascertained this out of the entry in the public register, <b>or simply made a conjecture from what they observed that He was above forty years old, and that He certainly was not one of only thirty years of age. For it is altogether unreasonable to suppose that they were mistaken by twenty years, when they wished to prove Him younger than the times of Abraham.</b> For what they saw, that they also expressed; and He whom they beheld was not a mere phantasm, but an actual being of flesh and blood. <b>He did not then wont much of being fifty years old;</b> and, in accordance with that fact, they said to Him, "Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast Thou seen Abraham? "He did not therefore preach only for one year, nor did He suffer in the twelfth month of the year. For the period included between the thirtieth and the fiftieth year can never be regarded as one year, unless indeed, among their Aeons, there be so long years assigned to those who sit in their ranks with Bythus in the Pleroma;

                            The above is also especially significant given that Irenaeus says that "all the elders testify; those who were conversant in Asia with John, the disciple of the Lord, [affirming] that John conveyed to them that information". And, "not only John, but the other apostles also". That is, Irenaeus is claiming a direct link to multiple Apostles for his errant doctrine.

                            Clement says God "entirely approves" of a man who is faithful to his wife, regardless of whether he is a laymen or ordained. Roman Catholics do not allow married presbyters, which both they and the Orthodox call "priests", but Biblically this is the same office as bishop (Titus 1:5-7). The Eastern Orthodox forbid a man to get married if he has already become a presbyter, which is also unbiblical (1 Timothy 4:1-3). Both forbid bishops from marrying, which explicitly contradicts the Bible's allowance for married bishops (1 Timothy 3:2, Titus 1:6).

                            This quotation is interesting for two reasons. Firstly, he is opposing Pope Stephen I, showing that he (and the bishops gathered with him) did not consider the Bishop of Rome's ruling to be final, nor did they consider him to have jurisdiction over them. His words on this issue are striking - "every bishop, according to the allowance of his liberty and power, has his own proper right of judgment, and can no more be judged by another than he himself can judge another". Consequently, none of them "set himself up as a bishop of bishops, nor by tyrannical terror does any compel his colleague to the necessity of obedience".

                            Roman Catholics, eager to get rid of this quotation, ignore the historical context of the situation, and say that Cyprian was only speaking of the bishops gathered at the council. This is wrong, as Cyprian speaks of "every bishop", and the fact that they "can no more be judged by another than he himself can judge another". The idea that there is an exception to this for the Bishop of Rome, who they were opposing, is absurd.

                            The second reason this quotation is interesting is because Cyprian's position that baptisms conducted by heretics are invalid is rejected today by the Roman Catholic Church.

And thus let him be proved when he receives the imposition of hands to sit in the office of the bishopric, whether he be chaste, and whether his wife also be a believer and chaste; and whether he has brought up his children in the fear of God, and admonished and taught them; and whether his household fear and reverence him, and all of them obey him.

                                3 In proceeding to make mention of these things, I shall adopt, to commend my undertaking, the pattern of Luke the evangelist, saying on my own account, <b>Forasmuch as some have taken in hand to reduce into order for themselves the books termed Apocryphal, and to mix them up with the divinely inspired Scripture,</b> concerning which we have been fully persuaded, as they who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers of the Word, delivered to the Fathers; it seemed good to me also, having been urged thereto by true brethren, and having learned from the beginning, <b>to set before you the books included in the Canon, and handed down, and accredited as divine;</b> to the end that anyone who has fallen into error may condemn those who have led them astray; and that he who has continued steadfast in purity may again rejoice, having these things brought to his remembrance. <br> <br>

                                4 There are, then, of the Old Testament, twenty-two books in number; for, as I have heard, it is handed down that this is the number of the letters among the Hebrews; their respective order and names being as follows. The first is Genesis, then Exodus, next Leviticus, after that Numbers, and then Deuteronomy. Following these there is Joshua the son of Nun, then Judges, then Ruth. And again, after these four books of Kings, the first and second 1 being reckoned as one book, and so likewise the third and fourth as one book. And again, the first and second of the Chronicles are reckoned as one book. Again Ezra, the first and second are similarly one book. After these there is the book of Psalms, then the Proverbs, next Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs. Job follows, then the Prophets, the Twelve [minor prophets] being reckoned as one book. Then Isaiah, one book, then Jeremiah with Baruch, Lamentations and the Epistle, one book; afterwards Ezekiel and Daniel, each one book. <b>Thus far constitutes the Old Testament.</b> <br> <br>

                                5 Again, it is not tedious to speak of the books of the New Testament. These are: the four Gospels, according to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. After these, The Acts of the Apostles, and the seven epistles called Catholic: of James, one; of Peter, two, of John, three; after these, one of Jude. In addition, there are fourteen epistles of Paul the apostle, written in this order: the first, to the Romans; then, two to the Corinthians; after these, to the Galatians; next, to the Ephesians, then, to the Philippians; then, to the Colossians; after these, two of the Thessalonians; and that to the Hebrews; and again, two to Timothy; one to Titus; and lastly, that to Philemon. And besides, the Revelation of John. <br> <br>

                                6 <b>These are the fountains of salvation, that he who thirsts may be satisfied with the living words they contain. In these alone the teaching of godliness is proclaimed. Let no one add to these; let nothing be taken away from them.</b> For concerning these the Lord put to shame the Sadducees, and said, Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures. And he reproved the Jews, saying, Search the Scriptures, for these are they that testify of me. <br> <br>

                                7 But for the sake of greater exactness I add this also, writing under obligation, as it were. <b>There are other books besides these, indeed not received as canonical but having been appointed by our fathers to be read to those just approaching and wishing to be instructed in the word of godliness: Wisdom of Solomon, Wisdom of Sirach, Esther, Judith, Tobit, and that which is called the Teaching of the Apostles, and the Shepherd. But the former, my brethren, are included in the Canon, the latter being merely read;</b> nor is there any place a mention of secret writings. But such are the invention of heretics, who indeed write them whenever they wish, bestowing upon them their approval, and assigning to them a date, that so, using them as if they were ancient writings, they find a means by which to lead astray the simple-minded.

                            Above, Athanasius explicitly distinguishes the divinely-inspired Scripture from the books which are merely appointed to be read for edification, mentioning Wisdom, Sirach, Judith, and Tobit as examples of such books. However, Athanasius errs in including Esther among the non-canonical Scripture, even though it is regarded as canonical by all, including the Jews.

                                9 Moreover, I have heard that certain persons have this grievance against me: When I accompanied you to the holy place called Bethel, there to join you in celebrating the Collect, after the use of the Church, I came to a villa called Anablatha and, as I was passing, saw a lamp burning there. Asking what place it was, and learning it to be a church, I went in to pray, and found there a curtain hanging on the doors of the said church, dyed and embroidered. <b>It bore an image either of Christ or of one of the saints; I do not rightly remember whose the image was. Seeing this, and being loth that an image of a man should be hung up in Christ's church contrary to the teaching of the Scriptures, I tore it asunder and advised the custodians of the place to use it as a winding sheet for some poor person.</b> They, however, murmured, and said that if I made up my mind to tear it, it was only fair that I should give them another curtain in its place. As soon as I heard this, I promised that I would give one, and said that I would send it at once. <br> <br>
                                
                                Since then there has been some little delay, due to the fact that I have been seeking a curtain of the best quality to give to them instead of the former one, and thought it right to send to Cyprus for one. I have now sent the best that I could find, and I beg that you will order the presbyter of the place to take the curtain which I have sent from the hands of the Reader, and <b>that you will afterwards give directions that curtains of the other sort - opposed as they are to our religion - shall not be hung up in any church of Christ. A man of your uprightness should be careful to remove an occasion of offense unworthy alike of the Church of Christ and of those Christians who are committed to your charge. </b>

                            Gregory of Nazianzus (329-390 AD) recommended waiting until a child was approximately three years old before baptizing them, so that they were able to understand at least some of what was going on:

                                28 Be it so, some will say, in the case of those who ask for Baptism; what have you to say about those who are still children, and conscious neither of the loss nor of the grace? Are we to baptize them too? Certainly, if any danger presses. For it is better that they should be unconsciously sanctified than that they should depart unsealed and uninitiated. <br><br>
                                
                                A proof of this is found in the Circumcision on the eighth day, which was a sort of typical seal, and was conferred on children before they had the use of reason. And so is the anointing of the doorposts, which preserved the firstborn, though applied to things which had no consciousness. <b>But in respect of others I give my advice to wait till the end of the third year, or a little more or less, when they may be able to listen and to answer something about the Sacrament;</b> that, even though they do not perfectly understand it, yet at any rate they may know the outlines; and then to sanctify them in soul and body with the great sacrament of our consecration. For this is how the matter stands; at that time they begin to be responsible for their lives, when reason is matured, and they learn the mystery of life (for of sins of ignorance owing to their tender years they have no account to give), and it is far more profitable on all accounts to be fortified by the Font, because of the sudden assaults of danger that befall us, stronger than our helpers.

Catholics do not allow female deacons, even in the sense of a formal, yet non-ordained office. The vast majority of Orthodox also do not allow female deacons, in the same sense.

This is despite the fact that, generally speaking, Christians faced more persecution historically than they do today, and lifespans were also shorter, making years-long penances even harsher than they would be considered today if the same timeframes of penance were imposed.

And these the Apocalypse of John represents by the twenty-four elders, who adore the Lamb and offer their crowns with lowered visage, while in their presence stand the four living creatures with eyes before and behind, that is, looking to the past and the future, and with unwearied voice crying, "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, who was and is and will be." <br> <br>

                            The Apostolic Canons are an appendix to the Apostolic Constitutions, covered above.

                            Many of the Canons assume the permissibility of clergy being married, for instance:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Apostolic Canons - Canon 5</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                5 Let not a bishop, presbyter, or deacon, put away his wife under pretence of religion; but if he put her away, let him be excommunicated; and if he persists, let him be deposed.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Neither the Roman Catholic nor Eastern Orthodox Church allow married men to become bishops. And, Roman Catholics do not allow married presbyters, which they call "priests", but, as mentioned before, Biblically speaking, this is the same office as bishop (Titus 1:5-7). 
                        </p>

                            Canon 25 requires that any clergy found guilty of fornication be deposed:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Apostolic Canons - Canon 25</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                25 If a bishop, presbyter, or deacon be found guilty of fornication, perjury, or theft, let him be deposed, but let him not be excommunicated; for the Scripture says, "you shall not punish a man twice for the same offense". In like manner the other clergy shall be subject to the same proceeding.
                            </p>

                            However, the Roman Catholic Church has admittedly tolerated Popes who held concubines or committed fornication, such as Pope Benedict IX (1012-1056 AD), and Pope Alexander VI (1431-1503 AD). <!-- Pope John XII (937-964 AD) -->
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Additionally, Canon 50 seems to require a triple immersion during baptism, which is not practiced by the Roman Catholic Church:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>

                                50 If any bishop or presbyter does not perform the one initiation with three immersions, but with giving one immersion only, into the death of the Lord, let him be deposed. For the Lord said not, Baptize into my death, but, "Go, make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost".

                            Pope Gregory I (540-604 AD) is significant because he was a pre-schism Pope, who rejected the Apocrypha as canonical in his commentary on Job, which was published after he became Pope:

                            Above, Gregory places the book of Maccabees in a category below the canonical Scriptures, following the example of Athanasius, Jerome, and others, who did the same.
