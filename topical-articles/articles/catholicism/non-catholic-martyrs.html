                        <h3>The Catholic Church's Historical Teaching</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Historically, the Roman Catholic Church has disqualified non-Catholics from the status of "martyr":
                        </p>
                        <!-- Denzinger 247 -->
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Pope Pelagius II - Dilectionis Vestrae (585 AD)</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                "The beginning starts from unity, and the primacy is given to Peter, so that the Church and the chair of Christ may be shown (to be) one: and they are all shepherds, but the flock, which is fed by the Apostles in unanimous agreement, is shown to be one." And after a few remarks he adds: "Does he who does not hold this unity of the Church believe that he has the faith? Does he who deserts and resists the chair of Peter, on which the Church was founded, have confidence that he is in the Church?" <br> <br>
                                
                                Likewise after other remarks he asserts: "They cannot arrive at the reward of peace, because they disrupt the peace of the Lord by the fury of discord... Those who were not willing to be at agreement in the Church of God, cannot remain with God; although given over to flames and fires, they burn, or thrown to wild beasts, they lay down their lives, there will not be [for them] that crown of faith, but the punishment of faithlessness, not a glorious result (of religious virtue), but the ruin of despair. Such a one can be slain, he cannot be crowned"
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Notice above, that after defining all those who "resist the chair of Peter" as outside the Church, he says that even if such are killed by others for their faith, they will still endure "the punishment of faithlessness", and "cannot be crowned". 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Similarly, Pope Eugene IV (1383-1447 AD) writes in the Ex Cathedra Papal Bull Cantate Domino, which was incorporated into the ecumenical Council of Florence (1445 AD):
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Pope Eugene IV - Cantate Domino (1442 AD)</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                <b>It firmly believes, professes, and proclaims that those not living within the Catholic Church, not only pagans, but also Jews and heretics and schismatics cannot become participants in eternal life, but will depart "into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels"</b> (Matt. 25:41), unless before the end of life the same have been added to the flock; and that the unity of the ecclesiastical body is so strong that only to those remaining in it are the sacraments of the Church of benefit for salvation, and do fastings, almsgiving, and other functions of piety and exercises of Christian service produce eternal reward, <b>and that no one, whatever almsgiving he has practiced, even if he has shed blood for the name of Christ, can be saved, unless he has remained in the bosom and unity of the Catholic Church.</b>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The above reiterates the teaching of Pope Pelagius II - that even if a "heretic" or "schismatic" "has shed blood for the name of Christ", they will nevertheless be damned for not having remained in unity with the Roman Church. Therefore, non-Catholics cannot be martyrs. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            And, to more robustly establish that the Catholic Church teaches that the labels "heretics" and "schismatics" apply to all non-Catholics, one can look at the fact that the Church has declared, "schism is the refusal of submission to the Supreme Pontiff or of communion with the members of the Church subject to him" (Code of Canon Law 751, Catechism of the Catholic Church 2089). No non-Catholic group submits to the Pope satisfactorily according to the Catholic Church, or else they would be Catholic. Therefore, all non-Catholics are "schismatics". 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The First Vatican Council (1870 AD) likewise says that "if anyone says that it is not by the institution of Christ the lord himself (that is to say, by divine law) that blessed Peter should have perpetual successors in the primacy over the whole church; or that the Roman pontiff is not the successor of blessed Peter in this primacy: let him be anathema" (Session 4, Chapter 2, Canon 5). This anathematizes all non-Catholics, as all non-Catholics reject this position. Additionally, Pope Boniface VIII (1230-1303 AD) explicitly rejected the Eastern Orthodox in <i>Unam Sanctam</i> (1302 AD), stating, "Therefore, if the Greeks or others should say that they are not confided to Peter and to his successors, they must confess not being the sheep of Christ, since Our Lord says in John, there is one sheepfold and one shepherd".
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            Therefore, examining the declarations that the Catholic Church has made around just the issue of Papal Primacy is enough to demonstrate that all non-Catholics are historically canonically designated as "heretics" and "schismatics", and therefore ineligible for the status of martyr. See <a href="../catholicism/there-is-no-salvation-outside-the-catholic-church.html" target="_blank">this article</a> for other such examples of formal anathemas towards all non-Catholics. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Catholic Church's Revision of Their Prior Teaching</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            In spite of the above, the Catholic Church teaches clearly, in one of the decrees of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965 AD), the exact <i>opposite</i> - that non-Catholics are rightfully recognized as martyrs:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h5 class="pt-2">Vatican 2 (1965 AD) - Unitatis Redintegratio</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                4 On the other hand, <b>Catholics must gladly acknowledge and esteem the truly Christian endowments from our common heritage which are to be found among our separated brethren. It is right and salutary to recognize the riches of Christ and virtuous works in the lives of others who are bearing witness to Christ, sometimes even to the shedding of their blood.</b> For God is always wonderful in His works and worthy of all praise. 
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            The above says that "separated brethren" "bear witness to Christ" with the "shedding of their blood". This is an explicit recognition of the validity of their martyrdom. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            To establish that this is truly a Catholic recognition of non-Catholic martyrs, one can turn to many statements of post-Vatican 2 Popes, namely Pope John Paul II (1920-2005 AD), Pope Benedict XVI (1927-2022 AD), and Pope Francis, which confirm exactly that:

                                37 At the end of the second millennium, the Church has once again become a Church of martyrs. The persecutions of believers - priests, Religious and laity - has caused a great sowing of martyrdom in different parts of the world. <b>The witness to Christ borne even to the shedding of blood has become a common inheritance of Catholics, Orthodox, Anglicans and Protestants,</b> as Pope Paul VI pointed out in his Homily for the Canonization of the Ugandan Martyrs.

                                83 I have mentioned the will of the Father and the spiritual space in which each community hears the call to overcome the obstacles to unity. <b>All Christian Communities know that, thanks to the power given by the Spirit, obeying that will and overcoming those obstacles are not beyond their reach. All of them in fact have martyrs for the Christian faith.</b> Despite the tragedy of our divisions, these brothers and sisters have preserved an attachment to Christ and to the Father so radical and absolute as to lead even to the shedding of blood. <br>
                                84 While for all Christian communities the martyrs are the proof of the power of grace, they are not the only ones to bear witness to that power.

                                And let us not forget our time, which has had many martyrs! Often, they are "entire communities that lived the Gospel heroically or offered to God the lives of all their members". <b>And the matter broadens further if we consider the ecumenical dimension of their martyrdom, recalling those who belong to all Christian denominations.</b> Let us think, for example, of the group of twenty-one Coptic martyrs recently introduced into the Roman Martyrology. They died saying "Jesus", "Jesus", "Jesus", on the beach...

                            Many more examples could be given of the above. And, because this has been repeated so often, and so clearly, it constitutes authentic teaching, which is binding on all of the faithful, as Vatican 2 (1965 AD) teaches:

                            The fact that is it now dogma that non-Catholics can be martyrs is really not disputable. This despite all of them, without exception, explicitly and necessarily holding to beliefs which separate them from the Church, according to historical Roman Catholicism.

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="article-body">
                            This is an indisputable contradiction in Roman Catholicism. Vatican 2 contradicts the Council of Florence. And, Pope Pelagius II and Pope Eugene IV would never have said the things that these more recent Popes have said, because they had a much more dogmatic, narrow view of the Church that excluded all schismatics and heretics, which previous councils had repeatedly defined as "all non-Catholics".
