1. The Orthodox anathematize those who affirm the filioque (Synodikon, Blacherne)
2. The Orthodox anathematize all those who submit to the Pope as the Catholic Church requires
3. The Orthodox anathematize all who use unleavened bread at the Lord's Supper
4. The Catholics anathematize all who reject the Papacy (Vatican 1, Unam Sanctam)
5. The Catholics anathematize all schismatics (Florence), and formally define schismatics as those who reject the authority of the Pope (Code of Canon Law)
6. The Catholics anathematize all those who know the Catholic Church is required for Salvation, but refuse to enter (certainly, an archbishop of the Orthodox Church, who is trained in theology, and canonically anathematizes you, qualifies)
7. The Catholics anathematize all who reject the Filioque

    The meeting with His Holiness Kirill did me well; I found a brother. And now, spiritually, we walk together.
    Finally, two words. One on Catholics’ respect for you, Russian Orthodox brothers and sisters: the Catholic Church, the Catholic Churches, must not interfere in the internal affairs of the Russian Orthodox Church, nor in political matters. This is my stance, and the stance of the Holy See today. And those who meddle do not obey the Holy See. That is for politics.
    -> He found a brother with a schismatic who damns him, and who rejects his authority, meaning he damns him right back

    With affection I greet each of you, the Members of the Delegation of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, who have taken part in the Solemnity of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul. I am grateful for your presence and I cordially thank His Holiness Bartholomew and the Holy Synod, who sent you among us. Through you, I send a warm greeting to my beloved Brother Bartholomew and to all the Bishops of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.

    This journey of reconciliation and pacification received new impetus with the meeting between Pope Paul VI and the saintly Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras sixty years ago in Jerusalem. After centuries of mutual estrangement, that meeting was a sign of great hope that continues to inspire the hearts and minds of all those men and women who today yearn to arrive, with God’s help, at the day when we can share together in the Eucharistic banquet. Ten years ago, in May 2014, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and I made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of that historic event. There, where our Lord Jesus Christ died, rose from the dead and ascended into heaven, and the Holy Spirit was first poured out upon the disciples, we reaffirmed our commitment to continue journeying together towards the unity for which Christ the Lord prayed to the Father, “that they may all be one” (Jn 17:21). I cherish vividly and gratefully the memory of that shared pilgrimage with His Holiness Bartholomew, and I give thanks to God the merciful Father for the fraternal friendship that has developed between us over these years. It has been nurtured in our numerous meetings and in the many instances of concrete cooperation between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church on matters of great significance for the Churches and for the world, such as the care of creation, the defence of human dignity, and peace.

    Your All Holiness, beloved brother in Christ,

    I likewise send the assurance of my fervent prayers that God the Father, source of every gift, will grant you abundant heavenly blessings through the intercession of Saint Andrew, first among those called and the brother of Saint Peter. The delegation that I sent once again this year shows the fraternal affection and the deep respect that I continue to have for Your All Holiness and for the Church entrusted to your pastoral care.

    His Holiness Neofit gave valued service to the Gospel and to dialogue, and despite his many sufferings remained a man of humility and joy, an example of a life consecrated to the Lord and his Church.  Since the Body of Christ on earth – the Church – is the gateway into the life of the Risen Lord, so for the Christian faithful, death marks a passage from this world to Life Eternal.  Thus, it is our prayerful hope that His Holiness Neofit is now living “where there is neither sorrow nor pain nor groaning” (Trisagion for the dead).
