                            <li>Why did Pope Pius XII (1876-1958 AD) state that the Latin Vulgate was "free from any error whatsoever in matters of faith and morals" (Divino Afflante Spiritu, 1943 AD), when the Vulgate contained the exact opposite teaching on the End Times that the original Greek contained in 1 Corinthians 15:51? Why did the Council of Trent (1545-1563 AD) state that the text of the Vulgate could not be rejected "under any pretext whatsoever", when it contained misreadings in Genesis 3:15, and 1 Samuel 13:1?</li>
                            <li>How many Ex Cathedra statements were there in the first 1,000 years of the Church? Why were there Ecumenical Councils, wherein issues were bitterly debated, often for long periods of time, if the Pope was able to issue such statements? <!-- From The Pope and Council by Von Dollinger, pg. 78 - (4.) For the first thousand years no Pope ever issued a doctrinal decision intended for and addressed to the whole Church. Their doctrinal pronouncements, if designed to condemn new heresies, were always submitted to a Synod, or were answers to inquiries from one or more bishops. They only became a standard of faith after being read, examined, and approved at an Ecumenical Council. --></li>
                            <li>Why is it that a Pope, intending to teach the entire Church on faith and morals in a regular Papal Encyclical, can err, but not when teaching Ex Cathedra? Why then does he not teach Ex Cathedra every time that he writes an Encyclical in order to preserve himself from doctrinal and moral error in teaching the whole Church? Why risk teaching heresy to the whole Church?</li>
                            <li>After watching a video like <a href="https://youtu.be/dQUBYL1sDBE" target="_blank">this</a>, do you believe that Pope Francis would ever issue a public declaration stating "not only pagans, but also Jews and heretics and schismatics cannot become participants in eternal life, but will depart into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels" (Pope Eugene IV, Cantate Domino, 1442 AD)? If not, why not?</li>
                            <li>How is Pope Leo X's statement that "Heretics being burned is not against the will of the Spirit" (Pope Leo X, Exsurge Domine, 1520 AD) reconciled with Pope Francis's statement that "It must be clearly stated that the death penalty is an inhumane measure that, regardless of how it is carried out, abases human dignity. It is per se contrary to the Gospel" (Pope Francis - Address to the Pontifical Council, October 11, 2017)? </li>
                            <li>Why is it that prayers to angels, Mary, and other saints occupy such a large aspect of the Catholic religion, when there are hundreds of examples of prayer in Scripture, none of which are addressed to anyone else besides God, and when Jesus Christ, when teaching us to pray, tells us to address the prayer to the Father (Matthew 6:9, Luke 11:2)?</li>
                            <li>Why did the Catholic Church forbid the laity from drinking the wine at the Lord's Supper (Council of Constance, 1418 AD), and then allow it again, 400 years later (Vatican 2, 1965 AD)? How is this consistent with the description of Communion given in the early Church (1 Corinthians 11:25-28)?</li>
                            <li>In excluding all married men from Church leadership, is the Latin Rite following the example of the early Church (1 Timothy 3:2, 3:12, Titus 1:6: 1 Corinthians 9:5)?</li>
                            <li>If the Church is built upon Peter, and this is to be understood as the Papacy, how do Catholics understand Pope Honorius I (585-638 AD), who was anathematized by name as a heretic by the 6th, 7th, and 8th Ecumenical Councils, and every Pope for a period of nearly 300 years (Liber Diurnus Romanorum Pontificum - Title IX)?</li>
                            <li>If one must believe that Mary was bodily assumed to Heaven in order to be saved (Pope Pius XII, Munificentissimus Deus, 1950 AD), why was the event not recorded in the Bible, or in the writings of any Ante-Nicene Christian, though they mention her hundreds of times?</li>
                            <!-- <li>Why did the Third Lateran Council (1179 AD) forbid Christians to live with Jews under penalty of excommunication? Why did the Council of Basel (1434 AD) consign Jews to ghettos, and force them to wear distinctive clothing? Are these things still binding on Catholics, and Jews who come to the Vatican? If the Vatican had control over more land, would they be binding on that land? If not, why not? </li> -->
                            <!-- <li>Why did Pope Pius V (1504-1572 AD) order "all and every one of the Jews of both sexes in all our temporal domain" to be "completely expelled" from the Papal States (Hebraeorum Gens, 1569 AD)? Was this a violation of Vatican 2's statement that the Church "decries hatred, persecutions, displays of anti-Semitism, directed against Jews at any time and by anyone" (Vatican 2, 1965 AD)?</li> -->
