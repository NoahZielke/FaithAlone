                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Grace New Testament Commentary - Acts 5:31-32</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                5:31 Peter relates the post-Ascension work of the Lord to Israel specifically. Not only had the God of their fathers raised up Jesus, He also "exalted Him to His right hand as Prince (cf. Acts 3:15; Heb 2:10; 12:2) and Savior" to their benefit. The right hand designates the place of royal privilege next to God the Father. Prince identifies Him as the Pacesetter or exemplary Leader or Captain whose career of suffering on the way to glory believers ought to follow (cf. Heb 2:10; 12:2). Savior relates to His work of delivering those who belong to Him as they pursue the same path to glory that He Himself trod before them. To give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins specifies the national repentance of Israel that would result in forgiveness of sins regarding their guilt as a nation. As in Peter's speech on the Day of Pentecost the forgiveness here identifies the unfettered fellowship that the nation would enjoy with their God. <br><br>
                                
                                5:32 Peter then specifies the role of the Twelve - "we are His witnesses to these things." They played a principal role in communicating these truths to Israel and thus they spoke officially for God. But they did not speak on their own. "The Holy Spirit" testified along with them (by granting them the ability to work confirmatory miracles and by enabling them to speak boldly and precisely about the Lord Jesus). Peter specifies that God had given the Holy Spirit "to those who obey Him." With this Peter implies that these religious leaders had not obeyed the Lord. They had not believed in the Messiah for eternal life, and had also fought against Him.
