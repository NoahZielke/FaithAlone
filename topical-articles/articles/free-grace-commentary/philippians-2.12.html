                                2:12 The phrase "fear and trembling" denotes humility, meekness, and respect, not terror (1 Corinthians 2:3-5: 2 Corinthians 7:15, Ephesians 6:5). Here, as in the previous chapter (Philippians 1:19), "salvation" refers to deliverance from the powers and trials of this present world (Philippians 2:15). This is an exhortation for one to conduct themselves meekly and with humility, and thereby secure the blessings and protection of God on their life.

                            <p class="mb-1">
                                (Salvation) Interpretation: People must work for salvation, or Christians must work to prove their salvation. <br>
                                (Discipleship) Interpretation: Once saved, Christians must cooperate with God to live out their new lives. <br>
                                Second (Discipleship) Interpretation: Christians must endure suffering in such a way that they experience deliverance by God. <br><br>

                                As you can see, the (Salvation) interpretation injects works into salvation either at the front end or the rear. It is not so common to hear Christians insist on works as a condition at the front end of salvation. However, it is very common to hear Christians insist on works to prove they are genuinely saved. All this comes from the assumption that the salvation spoken of is soteriological, or eternal deliverance from hell. <br><br>

                                One (Discipleship) interpretation also assumes this passage speaks of eternal salvation, but does not insist on works as a condition or proof of salvation. This view would note that the text says "work out" not "work for" this salvation. In other words, those who are saved should allow their salvation to have its intended effect in sanctification. This happens, this view would say, as believers cooperate with God who is working in us (v. 13). I am sympathetic to this view because it is at least consistent with the gospel of grace by removing works as a condition for eternal life. <br><br>

                                When we look at how the word "salvation" is used in Philippians 1:19, 28, the second (Discipleship) interpretation seems more consistent with this context. In Philippians 2:12, Paul draws a conclusion ("Therefore") from what has been said previously. Going back to Philippians 1:12, the flow of Paul's thought goes like this:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Though I am suffering in prison, I have confidence that I will experience deliverance from dishonoring God to victory through these circumstances so that Christ will be magnified. (Philippians 1:12-20)</li>
                                    <li>This deliverance gives me victory whether I die or live, though I expect to live. (Philippians 1:21-26)</li>
                                    <li>You who are also suffering can experience the same victory of deliverance as you trust in God and stay fearlessly united in the gospel. (Philippians 1:27-30)</li>
                                    <li>Because you will be delivered through these circumstances, you can therefore continue being selflessly united and encouraged by the example of Christ's selflessness and victorious exaltation. (Philippians 2:1-11)</li>
                                    <li>You should therefore continue to cooperate with God as you live out the benefits of your deliverance in your troubles. (Philippians 2:12-13)</li>
                                    <li>Your perseverance in unity will triumph over the evil world and bring me joy now and at the Judgment Seat of Christ. (Philippians 2:14-18)</li>
                                </ul>

                                This shows a consistent meaning of salvation as a deliverance from dishonoring God in the midst of the adversaries and the suffering they are causing. It is not only deliverance from this, it is also deliverance to a victorious attitude that endures in faith toward God and selfless behavior toward others. It is a sanctifying deliverance, not a soteriological one. Some have taken the deliverance (also in Philippians 1:19, 28) to mean a vindication at the Judgment Seat of Christ, a deliverance from the shame of an improper attitude and conduct. This would imply future rewards as well. While a good assessment at the Judgment Seat of Christ would certainly result from good attitudes and conduct in suffering, the passage seems to focus on the Philippians' present experience. <br><br>

                                A victorious sanctification experience is not guaranteed to Christians. It can be difficult to maintain a God-honoring life when persecuted by enemies or suffering difficult circumstances. By trusting God and the supply of His Spirit to serve others selflessly, we can be delivered from defeat by our enemies and our circumstances and delivered to a victorious attitude that witnesses to the world the truth we proclaim.

                                2:12-13 <i>"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling"</i> The word "salvation" means "deliverance." Paul did not advocate that the Philippians work "for" their own salvation. Eternal life is a gift from God not obtainable by our good works (see Eph. 2:8-9). Rather, Paul told them to "work out" their salvation. With a reverential respect for God, "with fear and trembling," they were to keep the example of Christ before them and rely on the Holy Spirit to deliver them from the power of sin in their everyday lives. In so doing, they would be used by God to attract people to Christ (v. 15).
