                                3:5-6 There are three main views of "born of water and the Spirit." The baptismal regeneration view is contrary to John's Gospel and the entire NT, since believing, not baptism, is the sole condition of eternal life. The symbol of regeneration view understands the expression born of water and the Spirit to refer to the life-giving work of the Holy Spirit parallel to "born of the Spirit" in v 6. Water is an OT figure for the life-giving work of the Spirit (Isa 44:3-5). While possible, there is a simpler understanding. The third view is that by born of water refers to physical birth (and to amniotic fluid) and that born of the Spirit refers to spiritual birth (regeneration). Two facts support this view. First, v 6 is parallel to v 5 and serves to explain it and it speaks of both physical and spiritual birth. Second, Nicodemus was clearly thinking about physical birth (v 4). While it is possible that Jesus would speak of spiritual birth only in v 5 (the symbol of regeneration view) and then talk of both physical and spiritual birth in v 6, it is more natural to take both verses as dealing with physical and spiritual birth.

                                3:5 <i>"Born of water and the Spirit"</i>: There are four possible explanations of this verse. One is that Christ moved Nicodemus from the concept of physical birth (water is an integral part of the physical birthing process) to the second birth, or becoming a child of God. A second is that water refers to the Word of God (see Eph. 5:26). A third is that the water is a symbol of the Holy Spirit (John 7:38-39). Still a fourth is that water and Spirit are one unit referring to the second birth from above needed to enter His kingdom. <br><br>
                                
                                Jesus used terms that a scholar of the Old Testament should have recognized immediately: water and Spirit, which are linked in Isaiah 44 and Ezekiel 36 as the spiritual regeneration from above that will be brought about by the Messiah. The water in the Old Testament passages and here is not baptism or even physical water. It is a symbol for cleansing from sin by the presence of God's Spirit within. Regardless of one's view, the verse is not teaching physical baptism is essential to one's salvation. We are saved by trusting Christ alone to save us (John 3:16).

                            <p class="mb-1">
                                3:5 The definite article translated "the" before "Spirit" is absent in the Greek text. The English translators have inserted it to clarify their interpretation of "spirit" (Gr. <i>pneuma</i>) as the Holy Spirit. A more literal translation would be simply "born of water and spirit." <br> <br>
                                
                                The construction of the phrase being born of water and the Spirit in the Greek text indicates that the preposition "of" governs both water and Spirit. This means that Jesus was clarifying regeneration by using two terms that both describe the new birth. He was not saying that two separate things have to be present for regeneration to take place. It has but one Source. Jesus' criticism of Nicodemus for not understanding these things (v. 10) indicates that what He taught about the Source of regeneration was clear in the Old Testament. <br> <br>
                                
                                The only view that seems to be consistent with all of these factors is as follows: The Old Testament often used "water" metaphorically in order to symbolize spiritual cleansing and renewal (Num. 19:17-19; Isa. 55:1-3; cf. Ps. 51:10; Jer. 2:13; 17:13; Zech. 14:8). God's "spirit" (or "Spirit") in the Old Testament represents God's life (Gen. 1:2; 2:7; 6:3; Job 34:14). God previously promised that He would pour out His Spirit on people like water (Isa. 32:15-16; Joel 2:28-29). The result of that outpouring would be a new heart for those on whom the Spirit came (Jer. 31:31-34; Ezek. 36:26). Thus the revelation that God would bring cleansing and renewal like water, by means of or affected by His Spirit, was clear in the Old Testament. <br> <br>

                                Another popular view is that "water" refers to the written Word of God, and "spirit" refers to the Holy Spirit. This figurative use of "water" does exist in the New Testament (cf. Eph. 5:26), but it is uncommon in the Old Testament. It is unlikely that Nicodemus would have associated water with the Word of God, and it would have been unfair for Jesus to rebuke him for not having done so. This view, like the former one, also specifies two separate entities. But again, the Greek text implies only one as the source of regeneration. <br> <br>
                                
                                Some commentators take the "water" as an allusion to water baptism, and the "spirit" as referring to the Holy Spirit. According to this view spiritual birth happens only when a person undergoes water baptism, and as a result experiences regeneration by the Holy Spirit. Some advocates of this view see support for it in the previous reference to water baptism (1:26, 33). But Scripture is very clear that water baptism is a testimony to salvation, not a prerequisite for it (cf. John 3:16, 36; Eph. 2:8-9; Titus 3:5). In addition, this meaning would have had no significance for Nicodemus. He knew nothing of Christian baptism. Furthermore, Jesus never mentioned water baptism again in clarifying the new birth to Nicodemus.

                                3:5 Christ changes "born again" (vs. 3) to "born of water and of the Spirit" in answer to Nicodemus' question in verse 4. "Born of water" is obviously a reference to the <i>first</i> birth, the <i>physical</i> birth, just as it is in Genesis 1:20, Isaiah 48:1, and Proverbs 5:16-18. That is why Jesus says that "born of water" is "born of the flesh" in verse 6. It has no reference to baptism of any kind.
