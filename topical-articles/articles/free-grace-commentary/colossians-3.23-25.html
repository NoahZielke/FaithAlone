                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Grace New Testament Commentary - Colossians 3:22-25</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                3:22-25 Just as Paul included instructions for the common relationship of slaves to their masters in his letter to the Ephesians (Ephesians 6:5-9), so he does here as well. Rather than comment on this social institution, Paul uses it as an example of submission. Servants, who are told to obey in all things their masters, are seen as having masters only according to the flesh. This statement points out that while earthly relationships may differ, in Christ believers are all on equal footing (Gal 3:28). Their inner motivation should not stem from trying to please only their masters as men-pleasers, but serving heartily, as to the Lord, since it is He who gives the reward of the inheritance. The fact remains that no matter what relationship a person is in - whether marriage, family, or work - he is to serve the Lord Christ. Believers will be rewarded for their service to Christ, but if they do wrong they will be repaid for it. There is no partiality with God (Acts 10:34; Rom 2:11; Gal 2:6; Eph 6:9).
                            </p>
