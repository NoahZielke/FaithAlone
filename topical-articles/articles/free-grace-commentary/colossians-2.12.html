                            <p class="mb-1">
                                2:12 In Romans 6:3-4, Galatians 3:27, and Colossians 2:12, the Apostle Paul speaks of being "baptized into Jesus Christ", and being "buried with (Jesus Christ) in baptism". In each case, it seems that this is either a reference to the baptism of the Spirit into the Body of Christ, mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12:12-13, which happens when a person believes in Jesus (Ephesians 1:12-14), or, it is the Apostle Paul expounding the symbolism of water baptism, which represents dying to oneself (Luke 9:23, Galatians 2:20), and walking in the newness of life secured by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. None of the passages, however, specifically mention water baptism, and the word "baptism" can be used in multiple senses in Scripture, including as a euphemism for physical death (Matthew 20:22-23, Mark 10:38-39, Luke 12:50), and when used to refer to the baptism of the Holy Spirit, it is even contrasted with a water baptism (Matthew 3:11, Mark 1:8, Luke 3:16, Acts 1:5).

                                2:12 By trusting in Jesus for eternal life, each believer is identified as having undergone the same burial and resurrection as that of Christ. This is the picture conveyed by water baptism, the reality that the believer has already trusted Christ and has been buried and then raised to life with Him. Therefore believers will live forever in Christ because Christ Himself lives forever. All this is not through man's effort or good works but only through the working of God. The baptism Paul refers to here is not water baptism, since no good work (even the ones commanded by God) adds, brings, or proves salvation. Rather, Paul is referring to the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the sealing of God's Spirit on each believer the moment he places his faith in Christ (Rom 6:3-4: 1 Cor 12:13; Gal 3:27; Eph 1:13).
