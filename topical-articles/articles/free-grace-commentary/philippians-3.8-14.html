                                8 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,<br>

                                3:8-14 Verse 8's mention of "winning Christ" refers to a more intimate relationship with Jesus Christ, either in this life, or with the expectation of a greater intimacy with the Lord in the Kingdom as a reward for work done during this life. Verse 9 is a statement of the reality of the Apostle Paul's standing in Christ, being emphasized because it is the basis from which he is able to live out the "power of (the) resurrection" of Jesus Christ (verse 10), a theme mentioned often in his epistles (Romans 6:4-5, 8:10-11, Ephesians 2:5-6, Colossians 2:12, 3:1-3). This is a relationship with Christ that goes beyond mere Salvation, as the fact that the Apostle Paul already possesses Jesus Christ positionally, as a member of His Body, is declared clearly elsewhere in his writings (Romans 8:38-39, Galatians 2:20). Being ever more devoted to Christ is how the Apostle Paul strove to obtain the better, more abundant resurrection (Hebrews 11:35: 2 Peter 1:11) of verse 11 (<i>exanastasis</i>, only used here), the "high calling of God in Christ Jesus", which he had not yet counted himself to have obtained (verses 12-14).

                            <p class="mb-1">
                                3:10 Since his positional righteousness comes from Christ, Paul's present goal is to be like Christ. He wants his positional righteousness to translate into practical righteousness. He wants to know Christ relationally and to experience His resurrection power in his life. Similarly Paul expressed this to the Romans: "For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by his life" (Rom 5:10). The risen Christ who indwells every believer (Gal 2:20) provides the ongoing spiritual resources necessary for them to live in accord with the Word of God and to be delivered from the power of sin in his life. <br><br> 
                                
                                As Paul suffers for Christ in prison, he feels a kindred fellowship with the One who suffered for him. He can accomplish this lifestyle by totally committing himself to Christ who also totally committed Himself to die for the sin of mankind. The Lord's example of complete obedience to the will of His Heavenly Father is Paul's model for his own life. Paul wants his life to reflect the attitude and actions of his Lord, who was "obedient to... the death of the cross" (Phil 2:8). <br><br>
                                
                                3:11 With the model of Christ in mind, Paul states his desire to attain to the resurrection from the dead. The Greek word for resurrection here is <i>exanastasis</i>, the only time the word is used in the NT (the resurrection of Jesus in Philippians 3:10 is <i>anastasis</i>). Paul is either looking forward to his own out-resurrection at the Rapture of the church and thus his subsequent triumphant stand before his Lord at the Judgment Seat of Christ, or, with Christ as his pattern, he wants to experience His resurrection power in this life now.  <br><br>

                                3:12 Paul now moves into his final section about selflessness. This quality may be realized through making Christ the priority in one's life (Philippians 1:12-2:30). This right priority is founded on the right position of righteousness in Christ through faith (Philippians 3:1-11). This last section in the body of the epistle (Philippians 3:12-4:9) is focused on having the right purpose, namely, living for Christ with the right perspective and practice that leads to selflessness. <br><br> 
                                
                                A realist, Paul understands that he has not grown in his relationship with Christ to the point that he can claim to be completely mature in Him. So he presses on in this life so that he can reach the level of maturity in his walk with Christ that his Lord wants for him. Since Christ laid hold of Paul "for good works" (cf. Eph 2:10), for which he will be rewarded (cf. 2 Cor 5:9-10), Paul continually works for Christ. <br><br>

                                3:13-14 Paul has a three-part plan to be the complete person God wants him to be. First, he understands that he has not arrived at the point of total maturity. When he wrote this letter, Paul had been ministering for Christ for almost thirty years. And yet he understands that he still is not what he could be. The realization by the believer of his inadequacy is foundational for the kind of selfless living Paul is advocating. <br><br>
                                
                                Second, Paul puts his past behind him. The believer cannot undo past attitudes and actions. In Paul's case his past included legalism and severe persecution of the church. These two things might tend to weigh a person down later in life. Surely, Paul regretted many things he did. But instead of selfishly dwelling on his negative past, Paul set it aside and selflessly changed perspective to a positive future of reward by Christ. <br><br> 
                                
                                Paul's third step is to manifest this eternal perspective and press toward reward. Paul is not reaching forward for his eternal salvation, the upward call of God, but is persevering for the prize (<i>brabeion</i>; used only here and in 1 Cor 9:24) of the upward call. Paul seems ever cognizant of the reward God will have for him at the Judgment Seat of Christ (cf. 1 Cor 9:24-27: 2 Tim 4:7-8). He lives his life with an eternal perspective that looks forward to the day when he can reign with Christ (2 Tim 2:12). Paul refused to get excessively bogged down in his circumstances, difficult though they were. He, instead, lived with the purposeful perspective of enduring faithfulness in light of everlasting reward.

                            <p class="mb-1">
                                (Salvation) Interpretation: Salvation is the prize for those who persevere. <br>
                                (Discipleship) Interpretation: The deeper experience of Christ's suffering and power is the prize for those who persevere. <br><br>

                                It is good to remind ourselves of something we have already discussed: there is a gift and there is a prize. Eternal salvation is a free gift to the unbeliever, but rewards for faithfulness are a prize to be earned by the believer. Which is the apostle Paul addressing here? <br><br>

                                It does not appear to be eternal salvation, because it is clear that Paul does not question his salvation in this epistle or elsewhere. Should he do that, he would contradict his bold exhortations to the readers of his epistles, undermine his authority as an apostle, and make vapid his exposition of the gospel as a sure promise of salvation. This passage shows that Paul was pursuing something else - a prize. His testimony is that "Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me" (Philippians 3:12) and on that basis, he now seeks to possess fully what Christ has intended for him. That purpose is explained in verse 14 as "the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus," which is most likely a reference to what he described earlier as his desire in verses 10-11: to know Christ (in the sense of a deeper experiential knowledge), to experience the same power that raised Christ from the dead, and experience the fellowship of Christ's sufferings (not for sin, but for doing right). Paul sought to enter into a complete identification with Jesus Christ in His experience of suffering and resurrection power (cf. Rom. 6:4-5). Life experience shows us that those who suffer a trial together enjoy a special fellowship in a way that others cannot. Consider, for example, the common bond between women who have suffered through pregnancy, or between those who have suffered with cancer. <br><br>

                                Paul also proclaims his desire to "attain to the resurrection from the dead" (Philippians 3:11). Of what does Paul speak? There are many interpretations, but the key seems to be in the unique word used for resurrection, which would be translated literally as "out-resurrection" (<i>exanastasin</i>). It seems Paul is referring to the imminent Rapture event in which dead believers are raised from the grave (that is, from among the dead) and living believers are transformed as both groups meet the Lord Jesus in the air. Paul is saying that he hopes to live until that event. He is not doubting his rapture or resurrection - "if, by any means" (<i>ei pós</i> with the subjunctive voice in the verb) is well translated by the NIV "and so, somehow," reflecting more of a desired outcome, and "attain" (from <i>katantaó</i>) can have the meaning "to arrive at." <br><br>

                                So the (Discipleship) interpretation of this passage does not make Paul doubtful of his salvation or resurrection, but expresses his desire to fully experience the suffering and power of Jesus Christ until, should he live so long, he is raptured from this life. <br><br>

                                Besides the exegetical and theological problems of a (Salvation) interpretation which makes Paul doubting his salvation and seeking to earn it, there are sad practical consequences to such a view because it misses what should be every Christian's goal. Like Paul, we should seek to experience a deeper fellowship with Christ through suffering for righteousness like He did, and we should want to experience the greatness of God's resurrecting power like Christ did. But this deeper experience does not come as a gift; believers must "press on" or persevere in faithfulness towards that goal and this resulting prize that God desires for every believer. Unfortunately, a (Salvation) interpretation does not offer this blessed prospect.

                                3:11 Paul was not working for the privilege of coming up from the dead. Every Christian is coming up from the dead as soon as he hears the "shout" (1 Thess. 4:15-17: 1 Cor. 15:52; John 10:1-4; Rev. 4:1-2). The "attaining," in this verse, is the attainment of a high degree of rewards (vs. 14) at "the resurrection of the dead." It is called "a better resurrection" in Hebrews 11:35, and in that verse it is the rewards that come from being a martyr for Jesus Christ.
