                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Grace New Testament Commentary - 1 John 2:15-17</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                2:15 The world - a moral and spiritual system designed to draw humanity away from the living God - is profoundly seductive (see v 16), and no Christian, however advanced, is fully immune to its allurements. If a Christian does love the world or the things in it, he does not love God. John is not saying that God does not love those who love the world, but that God's love is not working in and through those who love the world. It is impossible to love both the world and God at the same time. <br><br>
                                
                                2:16 All that is in the world can be summarized under three categories the apostle names here. Taken together they summarize the totality of the allurements of this godless system. The first is the lust of the flesh, that is, every illicit physical activity that appeals to people's sinful hearts. These are those things the flesh craves, such as illicit sexual pleasure or addictive drugs. The second element of the world is the lust of the eyes, that is, whatever is visually appealing but not proper to desire or obtain. The object before the eyes might be a person or thing, but the desire to have it is what is called elsewhere as covetousness. The pride of life means "the vain display of earthly life." The Greek word rendered "pride" is <i>alazoneia</i> (arrogance, pretentiousness, or boasting about self, possessions, or accomplishments).  <br><br>
                                
                                The Revisionists (being warned against) probably maintained that one could freely participate in the activities of the world. They may have argued that since God is its Maker, one was simply using what the Creator had made. But although the physical world is "of God" who created it, the world as a moral system is not. All that is in the world bears the taint of wickedness (cf. 1 John 1:5).  <br><br>
                                
                                2:17 The world is also transient: The world is passing away. When the world no longer exists as an entity morally and spiritually opposed to God, none of its illicit experiences will exist either. The lust of it, that is, the world's sinful gratification, is every bit as transient as the system it reflects. <br><br>
                                
                                By contrast, he who does the will of God abides forever. There is an eternal permanence to the character and activity of such a person. Since the "abiding" life has already been referred to (v 6) and is a prominent theme in the epistle (see comments on v 28), likely this is a reference to that kind of life. The one who does the will of God is inseparable from the Christ likeness which such a person has achieved. Likeness to Christ can give boldness at the Judgment Seat of Christ (1 John 4:17; cf. 1 Cor 3:11-15: 2 Cor 5:10).
