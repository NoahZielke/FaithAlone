                            <p class="mb-1">
                                5:28-29 Jesus is teaching about two different resurrections related to coming judgment. There was no cause for marveling in that, for the Judean leaders believed in two future resurrections. Probably what they would likely "marvel at [was that] all who are in the graves will hear His [the Son of Man's] voice." Since they did not believe Jesus was the Messiah, they did not believe He would have any role at the end of the age in raising and judging the dead. <br><br>
                                
                                Jesus speaks of the resurrections of "those who have done good [who will] come forth…to the resurrection of life," and of "those who have done evil [who will come forth] to the resurrection of condemnation." This may sound like works salvation. However, in light of the Fourth Gospel as a whole, and even in light of this immediate context (cf. John 5:24, 31-47), this is an impossible interpretation. <br><br>
                                
                                Some understand these verses to teach that all believers will be characterized by good deeds and all unbelievers by evil deeds. However, there is no such promise in Scripture. Some believers fail to advance beyond spiritual infancy before they die (cf. 1 Cor 3:3; 11:30; Heb 5:12). In addition, some believers do not endure in faith or good works (Luke 8:13: 2 Tim 2:11-13; James 5:19-20). Also the implication is that the reason the first group is resurrected to life is precisely because they did good. <br><br>
                                
                                This could be an example of Johannine use of absolute language. Positionally speaking all believers are holy and sinless. It is also possible that Jesus is pointing out the futility of salvation by works. No one does good (cf. Rom 2:7, 13; 3:10-11, 20). <br><br>
                                
                                Another view is that the reference to doing good alludes to believing in Jesus and that the reference to doing evil concerns rejecting Him. This fits the immediate context (cf. John 5:24, 39-47). It also harmonizes well with John 3:36, 6:29.

                            <p class="mb-1">
                                First (Salvation) Interpretation: Those who have done good works will experience the resurrection of life while those who have done evil deeds will be condemned. <br>
                                Second (Salvation) Interpretation: Those who have done good works as evidence of their faith will experience the resurrection of life while those who have done evil deeds as evidence of their unbelief will be condemned. <br>
                                Third (Salvation) Interpretation: At their resurrection, those who have done good - believed in Jesus Christ - will experience their eternal life while those who have done evil - rejected Jesus Christ - will experience their condemnation. <br><br>

                                At first glance this passage seems to indicate a judgment will take place at the resurrection of all people where everyone's works will be examined to determine if they receive the resurrection of life or the resurrection of condemnation. The first (Salvation) interpretation assumes that one's salvation is based on one's conduct in this life. However, we quickly realize this is contrary to the emphasis in John's Gospel on salvation through believing only. In John, believing results in eternal life while not believing condemns (John 3:18, 36). This is a case where an unclear passage must be interpreted in light of clearer passages. <br><br>

                                Those who hold the second (Salvation) interpretation would say that works are not the basis of salvation, but they are the basis of judgment. An examination of one's works will affirm or deny whether that person has truly believed in Jesus Christ as Savior. As in a court of law, the evidence will acquit or convict. We have argued earlier that this does not adequately separate works from salvation. In the end, with this interpretation it is works that determine one's fate. But is that what the context leading up to this passage teaches? <br><br>

                                In the context that precedes verses 28-29, Jesus explains to the Jews trying to kill Him (John 5:16-18) that He has the Father's authority to judge and to give life (John 5:19-22). He contrasts two different groups of people - those who honor the Son and the Father, and those who do not (John 5:23). Then Jesus
                                describes in emphatic fashion ("most assuredly" from <i>amēn amēn</i>) the group that honors Him and the Father: it is those "who hear My word and believe in Him who sent Me." This group "has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life" (John 5:24). This is a clear statement that those who believe in Jesus Christ have eternal life in the present and will not come into judgment in the future. <br><br>

                                Jesus then addresses two future resurrections awaiting mankind. While Jesus does not distinguish them in time, we see in Revelation 20:4-15 that these resurrections are separated by one thousand years. This alone tips us off that these resurrections are not the time of determining one's salvation, but only the time of delivering each one's fate. Jesus' preface to the mention of the resurrections is that He has "life in Himself" implying that those who have everlasting life are safe in Him as the Life (John 5:25-26). The resurrections parallel the consequences of believing and not believing in John 5:24. The resurrection of life parallels eternal life that is given to anyone who believes. The resurrection of condemnation parallels the judgment mentioned in John 5:24 as that which the believer escapes ("shall not come into judgment"). <br><br>

                                When Jesus refers to "those who have done good" (literally, "the good things;" <i>ta agatha</i>), the context leads us to understand this in the light of verses 23-34. This group honors the Son, hears (listens to) His word, and believes in Him. Conversely, "those who have done evil (literally, "the evil things;" <i>ta phaula</i>) is the group that does not honor the Son, does not hear (listen to) His word, and does not believe in Him. The fate of each group is settled by their previous responses. Their fate is not decided at their resurrection; their fate is only delivered at their resurrection. In the contrast of these two groups, we see John's fondness for stating things in contrasting absolutes. We see the same contrast with similar expressions in John 3:18-21. There, a person's fate is also sealed according to his response: "He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already" (v. 18a). <br><br>

                                Contextually, the third (Salvation) interpretation has more support than the second interpretation that considers doing good or evil as evidence of belief or unbelief. In John 3:21, the one who escapes condemnation is described as "he who does the truth" and in John 6:29 believing in Jesus Christ is spoken of as doing good or doing the "work of God" (see the discussion of Matt. 7:21-23). In other words, believing in Jesus Christ is the right thing to do, and it results in the experience of eternal life now as well as the resurrection of life in the future. On the other hand, doing evil would be rejection of Jesus Christ as Savior (cf. John 3:20). No one can do better than believing in Jesus Christ as Savior!

However, Christ expounded in John 6:29 that the only "good" a sinner can do that is acceptable to God is to believe (trust) in Christ. All other good flows from that trust.
