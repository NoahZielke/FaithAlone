                                1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.<br>
                                2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.<br>
                                3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:<br>
                                4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.<br>
                                5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.<br>
                                6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.<br>
                                7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.<br>
                                8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.<br>
                                9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.<br>
                                10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.<br>
                                11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.<br>
                                12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.<br>
                                13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.

                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Grace New Testament Commentary - Matthew 25:1-13</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                25:1a The Parable of the Ten Virgins is based on marriage customs prevalent in the time of Jesus. The custom Jesus refers to here is a wedding feast. The bridegroom, with his attendants, would go to the bride's home to claim his bride. This usually took place at night. A group of young maidens was selected to do a "torch dance" at the marriage banquet. When they would hear that the bridegroom was coming, they would go welcome him. After arriving, the bridegroom and his bride would go to the bridegroom's home in a long procession. The dancers would carry their torches to the festive marriage banquet where they would perform their dance before the marriage was consummated. <br><br>

                                25:1b-9 Five wise virgins are prepared for they had enough oil for their lamps or torches. But five virgins are foolish because they did not have a sufficient supply of oil. At midnight a cry was heard. This alludes to the abomination of desolation that will occur at the midpoint of the Tribulation (cf. Matt 24:15). At that time Jewish believers are to flee and hide (cf. vv 16-22). The wise virgins represent Jewish believers who in the first half of the Tribulation developed sufficient spiritual strength (via the Word and prayer) to sustain them through the Great Tribulation to come. The foolish torch dancers picture Jewish believers who did not develop the spiritual strength needed to enable them to live through the last three and a half years. <br><br>
                                
                                25:10-12 The foolish virgins' last-minute attempts to prepare proved futile. Such lack of preparation results in loss of opportunity. This parable stresses the loss of opportunity to enjoy the fullest blessings and rewards of the kingdom. Just as "the door was shut" to the five foolish virgins, so the door of opportunity for believing Jews during the Tribulation to rule with Christ in His kingdom will also be shut. When the bridegroom (Jesus) comes, the door of entering into the celebration banquet will be closed (25:11-12). Recognition necessary for inclusion is withdrawn (v 12, "I do not know you"; this contrasts with Jesus' words, "I never knew you" to the unsaved in 7:21-23). <br><br>
                                
                                25:13 This verse is not strictly part of the parable. It forms an inclusio with Matt 24:42-43. Believers in the Church Age know "neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming." Therefore they are encouraged to be watchful, anticipating the future consequences that a lack of vigilance could bring.

                            <h5 class="pt-2">Charles Bing - Grace, Salvation, and Discipleship - Parable of the Ten Virgins, Matthew 25:1-13</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                (Salvation) Interpretation: Those who are not prepared (through faith in Christ) for the Lord's return will be shut out from eternal life. <br>
                                (Discipleship) Interpretation: Those believers who are not prepared (through faithfulness to Christ) for the Lord's return will be shut out from honor at the Lord's return.<br><br>

                                This parable presents a challenge to interpreters. It is here that we remind ourselves that the interpretation of parables must look for the main point and then interpret details in light of that. The meaning of many of this parable's details are less than clear, but we can understand them well enough in light of how they contribute to the central point, which is essentially the same as the previous parable on the evil servant - preparedness for the Lord's return (made clear in Matt. 25:13). <br><br>

                                However, the crucial divide in interpretation is whether this depicts (Salvation) or (Discipleship). Of the ten virgins, are the five unprepared ones unsaved or saved? Is this a warning to unbelievers or to disciples? <br><br>

                                We remember that Jesus is speaking here privately to His disciples (Matt. 24:3) who are saved, with the exception of Judas. But certainly, Jesus is not tailoring this lesson to Judas alone as a warning to be saved. That approach would have to apply to all of Christ's teaching (except part of the Upper Room Discourse after John 13:30 when Judas left). This leads us to understand this parable as a (Discipleship message) for disciples. <br><br>

                                Eschatology, or one's understanding of the end times, also influences the interpretation. Some interpret the virgins as Jewish believers in the Tribulation who meet the Lord at His second coming. The foolish virgins are excluded from ruling with Christ in the Kingdom. However, the unknown time of His arrival and the lesson about preparedness seem to indicate the same event as the previous parable of the evil servant - the Rapture event that begins the Tribulation. Some who believe that this is the Rapture interpret the foolish virgins as professing Christians who do not really know Christ as Savior. At the Rapture, they are shut out from heaven and the kingdom altogether. The first word of the parable, "Then" (<i>tote</i>), may be significant in that it is only found here in the sequence of four parables and may indicate events following the Rapture, which is the focus of the previous parable. <br><br>

                                Who are the virgins? In the weddings of those times, a bride would have a wedding party of young women. She and the women would meet the bridegroom who comes for his bride to take her to his house. This usually occurred at night, thus the lamps. The approach of the bridegroom was announced with a shout, and after a festive welcome, the formal wedding celebration would begin. The church is compared to the bride of Christ in the New Testament (2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:25-27). It is interesting that the bride herself is not mentioned, but it makes sense that as the church, she is pictured as ten virgins so that distinctions can be made among those who comprise the church. So it seems best that the virgins picture the church. That these are genuine believers is supported by several observations. First, they are part of the bride and the wedding party (cf. 1 Cor. 11:2). Second, they are called "virgins" which at least suggests they are pure in the sense of having been cleansed and set apart to Christ. Third, they anticipate the coming of the bridegroom. Fourth, they are told to "buy" oil, which implies they must pay a cost, something characteristic of discipleship, but not the free gift of salvation. <br><br>

                                What differentiates the five virgins with oil and the five without is the central point of the parable - preparedness. While it is commonly understood that the five unprepared virgins ran out of oil, Jesus actually said they took lamps but "took no oil with them" (Matt. 25:3). If so, the lamps were not used in the daytime journey, but when night fell and the bridegroom arrived, they lit the wicks to their lamps only to realize that they had no oil to sustain the flame. It is possible that they had some oil in their lamps if their journey was at night, but not enough and they carried no extra. Nevertheless, the main point is that they were not adequately prepared. The other five virgins, however, were well prepared (cf. Rev. 19:7-8 where the Bride's preparedness is related to righteous acts of the saints). While we can speculate on the symbolism and meaning of the oil, all we can say for certain is that it pictures readiness. Readiness in the previous parable and the one to follow equates to faithfulness and good stewardship. <br><br>

                                The bridegroom's arrival has several aspects that point to the Rapture of the church. First, it is unexpected (unlike the timing of Christ's second coming, which could be known from prophecy once the Tribulation begins). Second, it is announced by a shout, which also accompanies the Rapture (1 Thess. 4:17). Third, it brings the bridegroom and the bride together at the end of the church age. Fourth, at the Rapture it will be too late to show faithfulness (buy oil). An interesting observation is that the Rapture happens too quickly to afford anyone time to believe and be saved (1 Cor. 15:52), while at the second coming of Christ there are Jews who see Him and believe (Zech. 12:10). <br><br>

                                A crucial interpretive question concerns the meaning of the shut door in verse 10 and the bridegroom's pronouncement "I do not know you" in verse 12. Both of these actions happen after the bridegroom's appearance, so they do not seem to be an exclusion of the five unprepared virgins from the Rapture. More difficult is the meaning of "I don't know you," so it may help to understand that first. This reminds us of the Lord's words to the unbelieving professors in Matthew 7:23, but there is a significant difference. There, Jesus said, "Depart from Me, I never knew you." Here, He does not send the virgins away, and does not use the word "never." Also, in Matthew 7:23, Jesus uses the word <i>ginōskō</i> for know, but here He uses the word <i>oida</i>. The first can denote a more intimate knowledge of someone, while the latter a more cognitive knowledge. In fact, <i>oida</i> can have the meaning acknowledge, respect, or honor (cf. 1 Thess. 5:12-13). This meaning fits well since Jesus consistently taught that those who honored Him will be honored by Him before the Father (Matt. 10:32-33). <br><br>

                                Putting these observations together, it seems that Jesus is excluding the unprepared virgins from the wedding celebration. "Afterward" (v. 11) could mean after the wedding or after the door is shut. It was the practice of Jewish weddings at the time to celebrate after the formal wedding service with a feast and festivities. These special privileges would not be extended to the unprepared virgins (just as they were also withheld from the unprepared wedding guest in Matt. 22:11-13). <br><br>

                                In summary, this parable is a (Discipleship message) that concerns the faithfulness of believers of the church age. All will be present at the Rapture and make it into the kingdom, but not all will be able to participate in special privileges there. They were not faithful in preparing for the Lord's return. This emphasis is consistent with the two parables that surround it. <br><br>

                                As believers, we have the exhortation to be alert for the Lord's return and always ready (1 Thess. 5:1-11). This posture helps us to be faithful, active in good works, and live a godly life (1 John 3:3). The Lord has special privileges awaiting those who prove to be faithful followers, privileges not enjoyed by those caught unprepared.

                                25:11-12 These verses picture the judgment that will happen at the end of the Tribulation and before the establishment of the earthly kingdom. Those who anticipated Jesus' coming and prepared for it by believing on Him will enter the earthly kingdom, but those who anticipated His coming but did not prepare for it by believing on Him will not.
