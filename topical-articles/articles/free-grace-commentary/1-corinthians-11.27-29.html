                                27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. <br>
                                28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. <br>
                                29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. <br>
                                30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. <br>
                                31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. <br>
                                32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.

                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Grace New Testament Commentary - 1 Corinthians 11:27-32</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                11:27-32 Paul addresses the manner in which the meal should be conducted. The person who participates in this meal in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. In other words, those believers who disregard the poorer believers at the meal come to the meal in an unworthy manner. Therefore each member should examine (test or approve) himself before eating the bread and drinking the cup. The one who does not examine himself eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. The verb discern means "to distinguish." The one who takes part in the Lord's Supper without proper self-examination does not make a distinction between the Lord's Supper and an ordinary meal. Because of this abuse, which reflected a selfish carnality, many are weak and sick among you - experiencing ill health - and many sleep - have died (1 Cor 15:18: 1 Thess 4:15-16). <br><br>
                                
                                If believers judge themselves, they will not be judged by God. Believers who are judged... are chastened by the Lord. This is a temporal judgment, not something that is eternal. If believers are judged in this way, it is so that they not be condemned with the world. God's discipline of His children is remedial (1 Cor 5:3-5). The individual who is not chastened is identified with the eternally condemned unsaved world (Heb 12:5-11; Rev 20:12-15).
