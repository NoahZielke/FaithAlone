                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Grace New Testament Commentary - Matthew 7:21-23</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                7:21 A profession of Jesus as Lord will not guarantee entrance into the kingdom by itself. Those who still cling to their pharisaical righteousness but profess Christ will not make it. Only those "who [do] the will of [the] Father" will "enter the kingdom of heaven." The will of the Father may be viewed from two perspectives. Jesus' interpretation of the Law is the Father's will. But to do this for entrance into eternal life requires perfect obedience (Matthew 5:48; Luke 10:25-37; Rev 21:27). This door, practically speaking, is shut. But there is still another way! Jesus said in John 6:40, "And this is the will of Him who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in Him, may have everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last day." The will of the Father is to believe in the Son. Obeying the will of the Father in this manner brings salvation.  <br> <br>
                                
                                7:22-23 The individuals in vv 22-23 do not do the will of the Father. Although they claim to have performed supernatural "wonders in [Christ's] name," at the Great White Throne Judgment ("in that day") they will be convicted as those "who practice [or do] lawlessness." Jesus will declare, "'I never knew you; depart from Me.'" These verses do not refer to people who once performed works only a saved person could do and then lost their salvation. The verses are referring to those whom Christ never knew. These were counterfeit believers, not real ones. Whether they actually performed supernatural wonders or not remains unclear. If they did perform such works, it could not be from Christ, but must have been of Satan. If they did not, they are simply fabricating an experience they never had.

                            <p class="mb-1">
                                (Salvation) Interpretation: Many who profess to be Christians are not really saved because they are practicing sin. <br>
                                Second (Salvation) Interpretation: Many who profess to be Christians are not really saved, because they do not know Jesus as Savior. <br><br>

                                This passage is often used to argue that not all who profess to know Jesus Christ as Savior are truly saved because they do not have corroborating good works. Works, therefore, are necessary evidence of salvation. While it is certainly true that not all professors of salvation are possessors of salvation, it does not follow from this passage that works are the determinative test. If anything, works in this passage actually show the opposite - that they cannot prove one's salvation. <br><br>

                                If we are mindful of the context, we see that this passage relates to the discussion of false prophets in Matthew 7:15-20 (see v. 22 - they "prophesied"). While Matthew 7:21-23 would surely include the false prophets, Jesus seems to broaden the application to "everyone" (v. 21) who makes spiritual claims. He focuses first on professing believers who are false prophets, then on unbelievers who are false professors. Like the false prophets, they have the outward appearance of true sheep. But these also have miraculous deeds and some correct theology, acknowledging that Jesus is Lord. But ultimately, Jesus Christ rejects them with the verdict that he never knew them. They are not genuine believers. <br><br>

                                Jesus' criterion for rejecting these professors of salvation is that they are not doing "the will of My Father in heaven." The will of the Father could not simply be good works because they had those. If they could achieve kingdom righteousness by good works, that would be salvation apart from grace. If works are the standard for entry into heaven or the kingdom, then they must be done according to God's standard, which is perfection (Matt. 5:48). But that is an impossible standard that even the fastidious scribes and Pharisees could not reach (Matt. 5:20). Then what is the will of the Father? It is to believe in the only One who could perfectly fulfill all the commandments in our place, Jesus Christ (John 6:28-29). <br><br>

                                The context leads us to the conclusion that trusting in the perfect righteousness of Jesus Christ is the only way to salvation. In Matthew 7:13-15, Jesus spoke of a narrow gate that leads to life (cf. John 10:9). Luke 13:24-30 also mentions the narrow gate as the way to salvation in a parable with similar language. There, Jesus answers the question posed by an anonymous hearer, "Lord, are there few who are saved?" Jesus talks about entering the narrow gate and those who are shut out by a closed door. He explains that false professors are excluded from the way of salvation, and they will grieve deeply as they realize their exclusion from the kingdom of God (Luke 13:28). <br><br>

                                The (Salvation truth) of Matthew 7:21-23 is that faith in Jesus Christ must be our only hope of eternal life. Doing good works are not a part of that saving message. Good theology, impressive deeds, and submission to Christ as Lord cannot save us. This group of professors had all these things, but they were not saved. All they had was self-righteousness instead of Christ-righteousness. <br><br>

                                The sad result of trusting in theology, good works, or submission to Christ's Lordship without trusting in Christ for His righteousness is that many who think they are saved have never really been saved. This is as true today as it was then.
