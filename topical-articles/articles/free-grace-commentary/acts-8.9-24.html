                                9 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:<br>
                                10 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.<br>
                                11 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.<br>
                                12 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.<br>
                                13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.<br>
                                14 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:<br>
                                15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:<br>
                                16 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)<br>
                                17 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.<br>
                                18 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,<br>
                                19 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.<br>
                                20 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.<br>
                                21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.<br>
                                22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.<br>
                                23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.<br>
                                24 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.

                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Grace New Testament Commentary - Acts 8:18-24</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                8:18 Simon now comes back into the story. Having practiced sorcery for "a long time" (see v 11), it stands to reason that he still had to deal with the desire for fame and power. Thus when he witnessed this supernatural occurrence He offered them money. <br><br>

                                8:19 Simon requested this power also, that anyone on whom I lay hands may receive the Holy Spirit. Significantly the apostles prayed for the bestowal of the Holy Spirit on the Samaritans, indicating that they did not have the automatic power to bestow the Holy Spirit of their own accord. Simon desired something not even the apostles possessed. <br><br>

                                8:20 The Apostle Peter prescribed temporal ruin for Simon as his punishment: "Your money perish [<i>apōleia</i>] with you." Peter had already witnessed the death of two believers in a context that likewise dealt with sin in connection with both money and the person of the Holy Spirit (cf. Acts 4:32-5:11). Simon thought that he could buy the gift of God (i.e., the Holy Spirit; cf. Acts 11:17). The only other use of <i>apōleia</i> in Luke-Acts clearly refers to temporal destruction or death (Acts 25:16). A survey of all the NT uses of <i>apōleia</i> shows that it more often refers to temporal ruin or loss (Matt 26:8; Mark 14:4; Acts 8:20; 25:16: 1 Tim 6:9; Heb 10:39: 2 Pet 3:7, 16) than to eternal ruin or loss (Matt 7:13; John 17:12: 2 Thess 2:3: 2 Pet 2:3; Rev 17:8, 11).  <br><br>

                                8:21 Peter pronounces an imprecation on Simon: "You have neither part nor portion in this matter." Both words (<i>meris</i> and <i>klēros</i>) relate to inheritance (cf. Col 1:12). Simon had no role in the (very temporary) apostolic privilege of granting the baptism of the Holy Spirit to new believers. Peter also gives the reason: for your heart is not right in the sight of God. Peter thus questions Simon's motives, not his standing with God. The NT abundantly testifies to the sad reality that believers can stray from the straight path (e.g., 1 Corinthians).  <br><br>

                                8:22 Peter does not tell Simon to believe in Jesus for eternal life. Rather, he exhorts him to repent of his wickedness that his "heart might be forgiven." The NKJV rendering "if perhaps" implies a slim chance of forgiveness for Simon. The Greek text more accurately speaks of the possibility or hope (cf. Acts 17:27, in the hope that) of God sparing Simon's health or life on condition of his repentance and petition (cf. 1 Cor 11:30).  <br><br>

                                8:23 Simon needed repentance and prayer. Peter correctly perceived him as "poisoned by bitterness and bound by iniquity." Soon after his conversion Simon had seriously sinned. His desire to possess apostolic power or authority had bound him to the point of his making an offer consistent with his pre-conversion manner of life and thought.  <br><br>

                                8:24 Simon then showed a change of heart. He recognized the Lordship of Jesus and apostolic authority. Simon feared loss of his money, health, and even life (v 20). The fact that Simon lived to make this petition is a good sign (cf. Acts 4:32-5:11). His request here reveals a repentant disposition (cf. Luke 6:45). He humbles himself and requests apostolic intercession.
