                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Grace New Testament Commentary - 2 Corinthians 5:9-11</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                5:9 Paul now draws some applications for ministry from his discussion in 2 Corinthians 4:16-5:8. Therefore we make it our aim whether present or absent to be well pleasing to Him. The word for well pleasing means to be "acceptable" (cf. Rom 12:2), and alludes to the Judgment Seat of Christ (v 10). It is there that believers will want to hear, "Well done, good servant" (Luke 19:17). Paul's perspective about life and ministry was centered on what he would hear from Christ on that Day. <br><br>
                                
                                5:10 For we must all refers to every believer in Jesus Christ in the church age. All Christians must appear before the judgment seat of Christ. The judgment seat (Rom 14:12) comes from the Greek word <i>bēma</i>, which was a platform in Greek towns where decisions were handed down by rulers (cf. Matt 27:19; Acts 12:21; 18:12). It also referred to a place where rewards were presented in athletic games. The modern Olympic games are based on the Greek Isthmian games, which were held every three years. In those games the champions received laurels at the <i>bēma</i>. <br><br>
                                
                                The Judgment Seat of Christ is where believers will receive rewards from Christ. This Judgment does not determine the believer's eternal destiny, for as Jesus promises in John 5:24, those who believe in Him shall not come into judgment regarding their eternal destiny. Unbelievers will be judged at the Great White Throne Judgment (Rev 20:11-15). But even there the basis of condemnation will not only be works, but the absence of one's name from the Book of Life. <br><br>
                                
                                At the Judgment Seat of Christ each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. The risen Christ will determine a believer's faithfulness to Him and award each person accordingly (1 Cor 3:11-15). These rewards are defined in Scripture as various "crowns" (1 Cor 9:25: 1 Thess 2:19; Jas 1:12: 1 Pet 5:4; Rev 2:10) and positions of serving and ruling in eternity (Matt 25:21; Luke 19:11-27; Rev 22:3, 5). Scripture does not state precisely when this judgment will occur, but it will be sometime between the Rapture and the beginning of the Millennium (1 John 2:28). Putting his suffering in perspective, Paul maintained the integrity that had always marked his service. He was living, not for human applause, but for divine praise at the Judgment Seat of Christ. <br><br>
                                
                                5:11 Thinking of his previous discussion about the Judgment Seat (v 10) Paul speaks of the terror (lit., the fear) of the Lord. This fear serves to motivate Paul to persuade men. He tries to convince them of their need to be reconciled to God (v 20). And since Paul lives and operates under the fear of God, he does not have any fear of offending the Corinthians. They are not the ones he is trying to please. Therefore his life and actions are characterized by integrity. All he has done is well-known to God and well-known in your conscience. Despite the claims the false apostles make against Paul, the Corinthian believers know how he taught them and served among them.
