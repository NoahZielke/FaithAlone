                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Grace New Testament Commentary - John 14:21-24</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                14:21 Jesus repeats and expands on what He said moments before (v 15). To obey Him is to love Him: "He who has my commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me." Of such a believer Jesus says, "He who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him." <br><br>
                                
                                While God loves all believers because they are in Christ, He has a special love for obedient believers. Jesus is teaching that progressive sanctification is by faith plus works. Rather than guaranteeing that all believers persevere in good works, this passage teaches that it is commanded and expected. <br><br>
                                
                                Jesus' self-disclosure to the obedient believer ("I will... manifest Myself to him") is probably referring to more than His post-resurrection appearances to the disciples, who were far from paragons of obedience immediately after His death. He is referring to giving obedient believers special insight into His Word, assuming they read, study, and meditate on it (cf. John 2:24-25; Luke 8:18; 19:26). <br><br>
                                
                                14:22 Judas (not Iscariot) [cf. Luke 6:16; Acts 1:13] asks a question which shows that he, and probably the other disciples as well, do not quite understand what Jesus is saying. He may have been asking how Jesus could "manifest [Himself] to [the apostles], and not to the world?" If He established His kingdom on earth - which is what the disciples thought He was going to do immediately (cf. Matt 16:21-23) - then He would manifest Himself to all. Or Judas might have been asking why Jesus would do this (cf. John 4:9). The latter is more likely Judas' intention in light of the answers Jesus gives in John 14:23-24. <br><br>
                                
                                14:23-24 This answer seems to be a restatement of what has just been said in v 21. Jesus is restating the reason He and the Father will abide with obedient believers. However, He states this in a unique way: "We will come to him and make Our home with him." The word translated home is the same word (<i>monÄ“</i>) used in v 2 when Jesus spoke of the many "mansions" or dwellings in His Father's house. In fact, this word is used only these two times in the entire NT. The implication of this link between vv 2 and 23 is that the present dwelling of God within believers is a foretaste of the eternal kingdom when God will dwell with them on the new earth.
