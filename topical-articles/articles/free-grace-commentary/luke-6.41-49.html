                                41 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?<br>
                                42 Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.<br>
                                43 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.<br>
                                44 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.<br>
                                45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.<br>
                                46 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?<br>
                                47 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:<br>
                                48 He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.<br>
                                49 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.

                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Grace New Testament Commentary - Luke 6:41-49</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                6:41 The teaching and example of the contemporary religious teachers may have already influenced those in the audience - to the effect that they focus on the faults of others ("the speck in your brother's eye") while blindly ignoring their own ("the plank in your own" cf. Luke 18:9-14). A focus on others' faults may betray an effort to ignore a bigger error of one's own. <br><br>
                                
                                6:42 Further, it makes no sense to try to aid the erring brother who indeed does have a speck in his eye, when the disciple does not "see the plank" in his own. Far from recommending that imperfect people/disciples not help others with their faults, Jesus instead first rebukes the faultfinder and then provides the proper procedure: "First remove the plank from your own eye." <br><br>
                                
                                6:43 The instructions here flow from the parable of 6:39 which points to the contemporary religious leaders. These will only count as "a good tree" when they remove the plank from their eyes so that they can properly help their brothers. <br><br>
                                
                                6:44 The Lord then gives a consequent summarizing principle which provides a standard for measuring the religious leaders. The contemporary religious leaders will not produce pleasant and nutritious "figs" (associated with blessing and fruitfulness) but rather will bring forth pain as do "thorns." Jesus here underscores the complementary relationship between a certain kind of plant and expectation of its fruit as a prelude to His convicting conclusion (vv 46-49). <br><br>
                                
                                6:45 Words reflect what one has stored up in the heart for "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks." They have a clear choice between the teachings and results of Jesus (the Good Man par excellence) and those of the contemporary religious leaders. <br><br>
                                
                                6:46 Proper and fruitful discipleship will do what Jesus says and not simply call Him "'Lord, Lord'" (Jas 1:21-27; cf. Matt 7:21). <br><br>
                                
                                6:47 Jesus then provides a picture from the world of construction that serves to highlight the stable, secure, and positive results that accrue to one who "comes to Him, hears His sayings and does them." <br><br>
                                
                                6:48 Jesus likens the coming judgment of the obedient one to a powerful flood whose "stream beat vehemently against the house" built on a stone foundation after deep digging. The river "could not shake it, for it was founded on the rock." If the disciple obeyed the instructions in Luke 6:27-38, they would have an unshakable life that would assuredly withstand all trials. <br><br>
                                
                                6:49 On the other hand, the person "who heard and did nothing" resembles one who builds "on the earth without a foundation" against whose house "the stream beat vehemently and immediately it fell." Jesus solemnly affirms "the ruin of that house was great." This ruin cannot refer to the rescinding or loss of eternal life. On the contrary, everyone who has believed in Jesus as Savior knows the final verdict already in the present without having to wait for the future (cf. John 3:16-18, 5:24-25 where God promises eternal life now, the very instant anyone believes His promise). Furthermore, they receive eternal life by believing - not by building (cf. John 6:47). As to discipleship, however, hearing and building on the right foundation constitute the way to a successful life. <br><br>
                                
                                The house metaphor may hold implications for Jerusalem and thus intimate the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD (cf. Luke 13:35; 19:45). Hearing and doing on the basis of the right foundation constitute the way to a successful edifice.
