                            <h5 class="pt-2">Charles Bing - Grace, Salvation, and Discipleship - Work of Faith, 1 Thessalonians 1:3</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                (Salvation) Interpretation: Justifying faith must include works. <br>
                                (Discipleship) Interpretation: Sanctifying faith produces works. <br><br>

                                The introductory thanksgiving given in this epistle is motivated by Paul's memory of three things which he states in parallel construction. When considered as parallel qualities, they refer to the Thessalonians' post-salvation demonstrations of good works prompted by faith, labor prompted by love, and patience prompted by hope. These things are the results of their election by God, their reception of the gospel, and their subsequent following of the apostles (1 Thessalonians 1:4-6). Paul is not stating that these virtues prove their faith, but only that he observed these things after their reception of the gospel. The faith of which he speaks in verse 3 is best taken as sanctifying faith (Discipleship), just as love and hope are sanctifying virtues. He doesn't allude to their justifying faith until verses 4-11. In his similar introduction in 2 Thessalonians, Paul mentions sanctifying faith as faith that grows and helps them endure persecutions and tribulations (2 Thess. 1:3-4). Also, we see the same term, "work of faith," used clearly of the sanctification experience in 2 Thessalonians 1:11. <br><br>

                                It is overreaching to use this verse to say that saving faith must include works. Such an interpretation is not derived from the text, so it must come from one's theological persuasion. We are saved through initial faith in Christ for good works which come from our on-going exercise of faith in the Lord.
