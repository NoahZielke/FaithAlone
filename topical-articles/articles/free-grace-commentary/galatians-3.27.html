                            <h5 class="pt-2">Abridged Commentary - Galatians 3:27</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                3:27 In Romans 6:3-4, Galatians 3:27, and Colossians 2:12, the Apostle Paul speaks of being "baptized into Jesus Christ", and being "buried with (Jesus Christ) in baptism". In each case, it seems that this is either a reference to the baptism of the Spirit into the Body of Christ, mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12:12-13, which happens when a person believes in Jesus (Ephesians 1:12-14), or, it is the Apostle Paul expounding the symbolism of water baptism, which represents dying to oneself (Luke 9:23, Galatians 2:20), and walking in the newness of life secured by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. None of the passages, however, specifically mention water baptism, and the word "baptism" can be used in multiple senses in Scripture, including as a euphemism for physical death (Matthew 20:22-23, Mark 10:38-39, Luke 12:50), and when used to refer to the baptism of the Holy Spirit, it is even contrasted with a water baptism (Matthew 3:11, Mark 1:8, Luke 3:16, Acts 1:5). 
                            </p>

                            <p class="mb-1">
                                3:27 This is one of the proof texts often used to teach baptismal regeneration. Yet it actually refutes it! According to the preceding verse, the sole condition of sonship is faith in Christ. Verse 27 further explains v 26 (note the explanatory gar at the beginning of the sentence). <br><br>
                                
                                The word translated "baptized" is a flexible one. It refers to being immersed, placed into, or identified with someone or something. All who have been placed into the Body of Christ by the baptism of the Holy Spirit are clothed with Christ and His righteousness! <br><br>
                                
                                This cannot be a reference to Christian water baptism for three reasons. First, there is no mention of water or anything related to water baptism in the context. Second, this verse is an explanation of the previous one. Third, if water baptism were a condition, then justification would not be simply by faith in Christ.
