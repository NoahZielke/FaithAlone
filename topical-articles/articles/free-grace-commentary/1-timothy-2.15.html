                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Grace New Testament Commentary - 1 Timothy 2:15</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                2:15 Few verses are more disputed than this one. Some believe Paul is alluding to the virgin birth. Others say Paul is teaching that salvation from hell is conditioned on perseverance in faith and good works. <br><br>
                                
                                The salvation here is clearly not salvation from eternal condemnation. The context is a woman's silence and lack of a teaching role in the church. How is a woman saved or delivered from that? Paul's answer is brilliant. "She" [singular] will be saved in childbearing if "they" [plural] continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control. Who is meant by the third person plural pronoun "they"? Some translations suggest that Paul did not know what he was writing and so they change "she" to a plural, "women" (e.g., NASB, NIV). But this destroys Paul's point. <br><br>
                                
                                In a verse dealing with childbearing the third-person plural pronoun unmistakably refers to the children of a woman. If her children continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control, then she will be saved, that is, fulfilled. Women have the most important teaching role. They teach the next generation of pastors, elders, deacons, missionaries, workers, doctors, homemakers, mayors, and others (cf. 1 Timothy 5:14: 2 Tim 1:5). <br><br>
                                
                                This does not mean that single women or married women unable to have children cannot be delivered from their inability to teach or exercise authority over men in church. They can teach other people's children. If married, they can find fulfillment in being helpmates for their husbands. If single, they can find fulfillment in serving Christ in the church, in work, and in life.
                            </p>
