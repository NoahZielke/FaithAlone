                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Grace New Testament Commentary - Jude 1:24</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                1:24 "God is able to keep you from stumbling". Just because God is able to do something does not mean that He will. Yet this does not mean one's eternal life is in jeopardy. The word "stumbling", another word unique to Jude, refers to the things about which he has been warning his readers. He is concerned that they will fall into sinful conduct and false doctrines. Thus Jude's readers are to rely on God to protect them from being deceived by false teachers. <br><br>
                                
                                Jude's remark is assurance that his readers will be protected from harm if they heed his instructions (vv 17-22) and allow God to work in their lives.  <br><br>
                                
                                God is also able to present believers faultless before the presence of His glory. This is a reference to Church-Age believers standing before the Judgment Seat of Christ for evaluation and reward (cf. 2 Cor 5:10). Not all believers will receive reward and commendation; some will shrink back in shame (1 John 2:28). The word faultless (<i>am≈çmos</i>) means "without spot, blemish or defect." It was used in the LXX to describe sacrificial animals that were without blemish, and people who exhibited integrity (cf. Psalm 15:2; 37:18; 101:6; 119:1, 80; Prov 11:5, 20; 20:7). <br><br> 
                                
                                While all believers will be glorified, not all will be blameless at the Judgment Seat. Only those believers who remain faithful to the Lord and serve Him will stand in His presence without blame.

                            <h5 class="pt-2">Charles Bing - Grace, Salvation, and Discipleship - He is Able to Keep You from Stumbling, Jude 1:24</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                (Salvation) Interpretation: God will not allow true Christians to stumble finally so that they are guaranteed entrance into heaven. <br>
                                (Discipleship) Interpretation: God is able to keep Christians from stumbling so that they can have a good presentation at the Judgment Seat of Christ. <br><br>

                                Those who interpret this passage as (pertaining to Salvation) find support for the doctrine of Perseverance of the Saints (all true believers will continue in faith and good works until the end of their lives). They believe that God keeps every true Christian from ultimately succumbing to sin. This proves their salvation and guarantees their entrance into heaven. <br><br>

                                However, if we note carefully the language used, the passage does not say that God "will keep you from stumbling," but that God "is able to keep you from stumbling." To say that God is able is different from promising that He will do something. The readers of Jude were warned extensively about the false teachers among them (vv. 4-16), then exhorted to take precautious actions (vv. 17-23). The implication of verse 24 is that if they take these actions, God is able to keep them from stumbling into error and sin. <br><br>

                                Often, the assumption is made that the faultless and joyful presentation mentioned is entrance into heaven. We know that the believer's justification allows him to enter heaven with no more guilt and with Christ's righteousness. But that truth imposed here neglects the statement about God keeping the believer from stumbling. The status of "faultless" must mean that the believer will be kept from stumbling into the error and ways of the false teachers. This is not a condition of eternal salvation, but a condition for a good and joyful presentation before the Judgment Seat of Christ. This important (Discipleship truth) should be familiar to us now: All Christians must give an account of themselves at the Judgment Seat of Christ (Rom. 14:10: 2 Cor. 5:10). We have also seen that the goal, as expressed by the apostle Paul, is to present every believer "holy, and blameless, and above reproach" (Col. 1:22) and "perfect" (or complete) at that judgment. As implied in Jude, Paul conditioned such a presentation on continuing in faith and steadfastness to the truth (Col. 1:23). Peter is helpful here too. In 2 Peter 1:10-11, he states that our spiritual growth (2 Pet. 1:5-9) will keep us from stumbling (2 Pet. 1:10) and give us an abundant entrance into the kingdom of our Lord (2 Pet. 1:11). Faithful Christians are not only given an entrance into heaven; they are given it "abundantly," which speaks of the quality of entrance. <br><br>

                                The lesson for Christians is to rely on God and His power and truth to keep us from stumbling into the error and conduct of His enemies. If we do so, we will enjoy a high-quality presentation to the Lord Jesus at His Judgment Seat.
