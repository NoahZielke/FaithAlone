                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Grace New Testament Commentary - Hebrews 5:9-10</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                5:9-10 Through His sufferings, Jesus was perfected (<i>teleiōtheis</i>). This cannot mean that Jesus became any more perfect in His nature, for as the Son of God He is eternally perfect. The Greek verb means to bring something to its intended goal. These sufferings served to complete the goal of preparing Him for His role as our High Priest (cf. Hebrews 2:10). <br><br>
                                
                                This accomplished, He became the author (<i>aitios</i>, the responsible cause) of eternal salvation to all who obey Him. If we say that salvation in this verse means personal salvation (or redemption) that comes from believing the gospel, then we have a theological problem, in that the verse seems to condition this salvation on obedience. Yet the NT is elsewhere clear that one's personal salvation can only be received as a free gift on the sole basis of faith in Christ and thus only by God's grace (Rom 6:23; Eph 2:8-9; Titus 3:5). Neither does the text say that those who truly believe the gospel and are saved will assuredly go on to live obedient lives. Though one might argue that the obedience to eternal salvation is the obedience of faith spoken of in Rom 1:5, in the context of Hebrews 5 obedience is a reference to works. <br><br>
                                
                                The best view is that eternal salvation in this verse does not refer to redemption from sin based on Christ's atonement. This is seen in several ways. First, of seven occurrences of "salvation" in Hebrews (Hebrews 1:14; 2:3, 10; 5:9; 6:9; 9:28; 11:7), not once does it clearly mean salvation from sin. In several cases (Hebrews 1:14; 9:28; 11:7), it clearly means something else, which should caution us from presuming a soteriological meaning in Hebrews 5:9. <br><br>
                                
                                Second, Christ's experience in Hebrews 5:7-8 is meant to parallel that of believers. He suffered, cried out to the Father for help, and was "saved," i.e., rescued through resurrection to share in glory. The "salvation" of Heb 5:9 cannot overlook the use of this word in regard to Christ's own experience just mentioned in Hebrews 5:7. <br><br>
                                
                                Third, the context has not been talking about a sinner's need for salvation from sin. This unit (Hebrews 4:14-5:10) began with the exhortation for believers who already "have a great High Priest" to hold fast their confession and turn to the throne of grace for help. <br><br>
                                
                                Fourth, the obedience mentioned in Hebrews 5:9 must be seen in light of the preceding verse. The verb "obey" in v 9 (from <i>hupakouō</i>) is clearly associated with the word "obedience" in v 8 (from the related noun, <i>hupakoē</i>). Thus the believer's obedience in v 9 is meant to be seen in comparison with Christ's obedience in v 8, namely, obedience connected with sufferings in the course of being faithful to God; not obedience in general. Furthermore this call for obedience to Christ stands in contrast to the disobedience that disqualified the wilderness generation from their rest (cf. Hebrews 3:11; 4:11). <br><br>
                                
                                If these verses do not mean justification and personal salvation from sin, then what do they mean? The context has highlighted how Christ was perfected for His role by obedience through sufferings, after which he experienced "salvation." Now He is in a position to help His "brethren" - those already sanctified - who are being brought to glory (Hebrews 2:10). Through Him, they can attain to eternal salvation (eternal, because it cannot be taken from them). In the context of Hebrews this means an eschatological salvation in which one shares in Christ's inheritance and reigns with Him. This is not automatic for believers; it is for those who obey Him - not a self-reliant obedience, but one possible through reliance on Christ as High Priest. This includes the obedience of holding fast one's confession and drawing near to God rather than rebelling (recall Hebrews 4:14 and compare the issue of rebellion in Hebrews 3:12).

                            <p class="mb-1">
                                (Salvation) Interpretation: Obedience brings the unbeliever Christ's eternal salvation. <br>
                                (Discipleship) Interpretation: Living obediently brings the believer all the benefits of Christ's salvation in this life and in the future. <br><br>

                                In the context immediately preceding this passage, the readers are told that Jesus Christ obtained His office of High Priest through His obedience (Hebrews 4:15; 5:7-8), which also qualified him to be the "author" (<i>aitios</i>, or cause, source) of salvation to others who are obedient. Thus in the same way, Christians obtain their blessings through obedience. The salvation in view here is not justification (nor is it used clearly in the sense of justification in its other uses in Hebrews: Hebrews 1:14; 2:3, 10; 6:9; 9:28; 11:7), but looks forward to their future experience of living in the blessings of the kingdom. The obedient act of initially believing in Christ is the first act of obedience that places sinners under the benefits of Christ's priestly sacrifice and ministry. But it is by continued obedience that believers avail themselves of the benefits of His High Priestly ministry, a privilege that can be forfeited (unlike salvation from hell). <br><br>

                                That this does not refer to salvation from hell is also apparent from the use of the present tense of "obey," not the past tense "obeyed." It is not continual obedience that saves one from hell; it is the initial obedience of believing in Jesus Christ as Savior. Again, the concept of salvation in Hebrews has a distinct sense of not only a final deliverance from hell, but a present and future aspect (Hebrews 1:14; 9:28). Continual obedience allows the Christian to enjoy the present aspects of salvation relating to the believer's rest (Hebrews 4:1, 3, 6, 9-11) and the benefits of Christ's priestly ministry (Hebrews 4:14-16; chs. 7-10), as well as the future aspect as something to inherit in the kingdom (Hebrews 1:14; 6:12, 17; 7:25; 9:15, 28; 12:28). Since the argument of the book is concerned with keeping Christians from falling away and keeping them in the full benefits of Christ's ministry, obedience for salvation is used in the sense of (Discipleship) for believers. <br><br>

                                We who are Christians should rest in the fact that Christ's present priestly ministry provides us all the benefits of deliverance from sin, confidence in drawing near to God, and an inheritance in the kingdom of God if we live obediently.
