                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Grace New Testament Commentary - Matthew 7:13-14</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                7:13-14 Those seeking entrance into the kingdom have a choice. There are two gates and two ways leading to two destinies. The "wide...gate" and "broad...way" is popular, but leads to destruction. The "narrow...gate" and "difficult...way" lead "to life." The terminology is similar to that of John 10:9-10 where Christ says He is the door to the sheep pen. One may enter only through Jesus Christ, and once he is in, He leads them to find pasture. There is a difference between receiving life and living the abundant life. Here in Matt 7:13-14 one enters into life by the gate and he lives that life by walking along the way. It is a narrow gate and a difficult way that is only through Jesus Christ (cf. John 14:6). Unfortunately, "few...find it." Though His offer is to the entire human race, only a relatively few trust Him and believe in Him for eternal life instead of depending on their own obedience. The many, however, who reject Jesus' offer of eternal life choose the way of human pride and self-righteousness which leads to destruction.
