                            <h5 class="pt-2">The Grace New Testament Commentary - Mark 8:34-38</h5>
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                8:34 His statement, "Whoever desired to follow after Me" means committing to walk the same path Jesus walks, which will end in suffering and death. This experience of following Jesus requires certain conditions. The follower is to "deny himself (i.e., to lose sight of oneself) and take up his cross." Though literally this means to carry the crosspiece to one's crucifixion, it is used figuratively for a deliberate choice to identify with Jesus, knowing it will involve shame and suffering (cf. Phil 2:8). <br><br>
                                
                                8:35 The believer who desires "to save his life" (<i>psychē</i>) is one who refuses to follow Christ by denying oneself and taking up one's cross. He does not wish to give his life for the cause of Christ and therefore, he "will lose it." The term lose (<i>apollymi</i>) signifies that a believer loses the fullness of his future life in the Kingdom when he lives in opposition to God's declared will. Scripture teaches that a believer may experience loss and/or reward at the Judgment Seat of Christ (1 Cor 3:14-15: 2 Cor 5:9-10: 2 John 1:8). Rewards will enhance life in eternity (cf. 1 Tim 6:7-19). Thus, a believer who actually thinks he is saving his life by avoiding discipleship is actually destroying his opportunity for future rewards. <br><br>
                                
                                When Christ says, "But whoever loses (<i>apollymi</i>) his life (<i>psychē</i>) for My sake and the gospel's will save it," He is describing the believer who follows after Him. Those who deny themselves and take up their cross to follow Christ may think they are losing their lives, but they are actually gaining them for eternity. When they get to the kingdom, their lives will be spiritually enhanced (cf. 2 Tim 4:8). Jesus wants His followers to know that as they enter into His sufferings, they can be confident of future reward (cf. 1 Pet 4:13). <br><br>
                                
                                8:36-37 Jesus uses an illustration within a question to reason why He should be followed. "What will it profit a man if he gains (lit., 'to acquire by effort or investment') the whole world, and loses his own soul?" The word soul (<i>psychē</i>) is the same Greek word translated life (<i>psychē</i>) in v 35 and should be rendered life in v 36. English translators intend for the word soul to mean that a person will lose his soul in hell. However, the context is clearly a discipleship/rewards context. Jesus takes the best-case scenario for His illustration. A man who gains the whole world is one who has lived for himself and has been successful in amassing great wealth. However, what profit will these vast riches be to him in eternity if he has lived only for himself? Such profit is worthless in eternity. He will leave all his wealth behind. As a believer he will enter eternity with a loss of the fullness of life he could have had. <br><br>
                                
                                Christ's second question in v 37 relates to this analogy. At the point the man enters into eternity, "what will a man give in exchange for his soul (<i>psychē</i>, 'life')?" What can he give to redo his life? His life is over and nothing can compensate for such a loss. Again, this relates to abundance in the life to come as a reward, and not deliverance from hell. A person should follow Christ because, although it is costly, he will preserve his life unto eternal reward and life enhancement. <br><br>
                                
                                8:38 One last explanation for following Christ involves His Second Coming. Not only will Christ suffer, die, and be raised again, but He will also return. Believers must thus live in expectation of this return. One who lives for self "is ashamed" of Christ and His words and joins in spirit with "this adulterous and sinful generation" (cf. Mark 8:12; 9:19). Whoever is ashamed of identifying with Christ, "the Son of Man also will be ashamed" of him (cf. 1 John 2:28) when He returns "in the glory of His Father with the holy angels." A final motivation for believers to follow Christ is to consider that they will stand before Him and should not want to be ashamed before Him.

                                (Salvation) Interpretation: To "come after" or "follow" Jesus refers to becoming a Christian. <br>
                                (Discipleship) Interpretation: To "come after" or "follow" Jesus refers to becoming a disciple. <br><br>
                                
                                Since these statements from Jesus about becoming a disciple are similar, we will look at them together. We notice that while Jesus was addressing the crowds, the disciples were always present (the disciples exclusively in Matt. 10:1-11:1). Since the disciples were believers at this point (John 2:11), and probably many others in the crowd as well, we should suspect that these conditions address the commitments of a disciple, not the condition for salvation. <br><br>
                                
                                Jesus' invitation is to "come after Me," not "come to Me" as in Matthew 11:28 (see the previous discussion). To come after or follow Jesus is the language of discipleship. It speaks of a life committed to Him. It is different from coming to Him for salvation. That these conditions are in the category of (Discipleship) becomes more apparent when we understand the implications of each of them. <br><br>
                                
                                The condition mentioned first in Matthew 16:24 (as also in Mark 8:34 and Luke 9:23) is that a person must "deny himself." As always, the context gives us insight into what this means. In both Matthew and Luke, Jesus has just predicted that He is going to suffer and even die. No one wants to die, not even Jesus (Luke 22:42), but He obediently goes to His death because it is God's will for Him. To deny oneself is to say "no" to our desires (good and bad) in order to say "yes" to God's will for us. It is a decision we make as we come to understand what God's will is, something an unsaved person really doesn't know. Clearly, it is (Discipleship) related to the Christian life. <br><br>
                                
                                A second condition mentioned in these two passages, but also in Mark 10:38 and in Luke 14:27, is that one must "take up his cross." Again, the contexts in which Jesus gives this condition have, as a background, His own suffering and death. The meaning is certainly not lost on the disciples and the crowds. Jesus is speaking of a willingness to suffer and die and He is inviting others to do the same in order to be His disciples. The emotional impact of His statement is diluted to our modern sensibilities. When the crowds heard the word "cross," they surely shuddered at the thought of being crucified by their Roman occupiers on wooden crossbars exposed to the elements in public, or lining the streets with other offenders and dying a slow humiliating death. In that day, crucifixion was the cruelest kind of death and included social and religious stigmas (such as God's curse, Deut. 21:23). <br><br>
                                
                                Though carrying one's cross is strong enough as a condition for discipleship, Luke 9:23 adds that this must be done "daily," suggesting Jesus is speaking not just of someone's physical death, but also a daily willingness to suffer for identifying with Jesus Christ. Now we clearly see why this cannot be (Salvation). How can someone be saved if it requires a daily commitment to suffer and die for Jesus Christ? And how does an unsaved person comprehend what suffering for Christ entails? Besides, salvation is possible because Jesus died for us, not because we die for Him. <br><br>
                                
                                The third condition in these passages is simply "follow Me." Again, as with His call to Peter, Andrew, James, and John at the Sea of Galilee while they were fishing, Jesus is inviting people to follow Him as disciples or learners. Normally, a first-century Jewish disciple would literally follow his master, live with him, eat with him, study with him. It meant giving up one's own agenda and goals for that of the master's or teacher's. Since this is obviously a process, not a single event, it cannot be (Salvation). <br><br>
                                
                                You can see how confused people can become if we tell them that they can only be saved if they deny all their own desires and adopt God's, are willing to suffer or die every day for being a Christian, and follow God's agenda for their lives. For that matter, we who are Christians rarely keep these commitments fully. For us, they are goals that guide our hearts as we seek to fulfill them perfectly. But to make such criteria conditions for unsaved people to obtain salvation will only result in doubt and insecurity about measuring up on the one hand, or pride because they think they have on the other. Salvation is not about our commitments and suffering for Jesus Christ; it's about His suffering and commitment to us. <br><br>
                                
                                You might wonder why those who are called disciples are given conditions for discipleship. The answer to this is that discipleship is a process, not an accomplishment; it is a journey, not a destination. The end goal is Christlikeness (Matt. 10:25), something that cannot be fully achieved in this life. There is a sense in which every disciple is challenged to be more of a disciple. Peter was challenged to follow Christ several times after his initial decision at the Sea of Galilee, with each challenge demanding more of a commitment. For example, one of the last challenges, which Jesus gave after His resurrection, was for Peter to follow Christ after he was told the manner in which he would die (John 21:19). For Peter, that certainly contained a specific commitment he had not yet encountered. For each of us as Christians, Jesus Christ challenges us to move to the next level of commitment, something that is relative to where each of us is at the present. We can always become more of a disciple.

                            <p class="mb-1">
                                (Salvation) Interpretation: If a person lives for himself, he will not gain salvation or he will lose salvation. But if a person forsakes his selfish desires, he will gain eternal life. <br>
                                (Discipleship) Interpretation: If a believer lives for himself, he will miss the abundant life that God has for him. But if he forsakes his selfish desires, he will find the abundant life. <br><br>
                                
                                These statements explain why the invitation to discipleship that we discussed above should be accepted. Whoever does so saves his life, or his soul. Immediately, when some hear the language about saving (or losing) one's soul, they assume a (Salvation) interpretation, taking it as a reference to salvation of one's spirit from hell. This is a problem created by the English translations of the Bible. <br><br>
                                
                                The word soul (<i>psychē</i>) is the same word translated life in these passages (which is how some Bible versions translate it). It refers to life in its essence, the immaterial part of a person comprised of mind, will, and emotions that forms one's identity. Your life is who you really are. This statement is helpful because it uses the word "himself" for "life:" "For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and is himself destroyed or lost?" (Luke 9:25). <br><br>
                                
                                It is also important to understand how the word save (<i>sōzō</i>) is used. As discussed earlier, it does not always refer to eternal salvation. It simply means to deliver, to preserve from some danger or loss. Usually, we determine its meaning from the context. Here, Jesus has just talked about losing our own desires and subsuming them to His desires for us. If someone wants to hang on to his own desires and agenda in this world ("save his life") he will lose what life is really all about - experiencing the will of God and the fullness of God's life. He may gain everything this world has to offer, but miss the greater experience of God's life now and as a reward in the future (v. 27). <br><br>
                                
                                Taken in this way, we see that the word lose (<i>apollumi</i>) is the opposite of save. It does not mean to be eternally lost in hell but has the idea of ruin or forfeit. To lose your life is to ruin it or forfeit what God would have it be. Someone can have eternal life yet waste the opportunity to enjoy life's fullness by living for God now. <br><br>
                                
                                If we interpret this statement by Jesus (Salvifically), we miss a profound principle for the Christian life. If we seek the things this world has to offer while avoiding the hardships that can be involved with knowing Jesus Christ, we lose the very quality of life we really desire. It is only by losing our life to God that we get it back fuller and richer than ever. When life ceases to be the issue, life becomes the reality. <br><br>
                                
                                We may think it is too painful to give up a consuming habit, a toxic relationship, or our own ambitions and plans. What we will discover is that in losing our life, we find true life - the fullness of God's abundant life now and forever.

                                (Salvation) Interpretation: If a person does not confess Jesus publicly, he will be denied salvation, will prove he was never saved, or if saved, lose that salvation. <br>
                                (Discipleship) Interpretation: If a Christian does not confess Jesus publicly or is ashamed of Him, that person will be denied the reward of Jesus' commendation before God the Father. <br> <br>
                                
                                These passages have a similar theme: If someone denies the Lord Jesus or is ashamed of Him, he will be denied before God the Father and Jesus will be ashamed of him. These are tough words, so tough that many interpret them (Salvifically): Jesus will deny entrance into heaven and be ashamed in such a way that implies the person is unworthy of heaven. <br> <br>
                                
                                Again, context is the key. In Matthew 10, Jesus is sending out His disciples with instructions and warnings about how they will be received and how they should not fear opposition. The warning of verses 32-33 about confessing (acknowledging) Jesus Christ could apply to those who hear the disciples' message, or it could apply to the disciples themselves, or it could be a principle that applies to both. Comparing Jesus' statement in Matthew with His similar statement in Luke 12:8-9, we find in both a common context about not fearing to speak to others about Christ. Though this could be a general principle, it certainly is addressed to the disciples first as both a warning and an encouragement. <br><br>
                                
                                In both Mark 8:38 and Luke 9:26, the statement is a warning without a corresponding encouragement. But this too is addressed to the disciples after Jesus tells them to deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow Him in order to "save" their lives. As we saw earlier, these are (Discipleship passages). Jesus explains that believers have choices and those choices have their respective consequences. One can identify with the world, lose his life, and earn Christ's shame, or one can identify with Christ. Though Mark and Luke's accounts do not mention a reward other than that one's life will be saved, Matthew's version goes on to speak of rewards in Matthew 10:41-42. The parallel account in Matthew 16:24-27 ends with a promise that when Jesus Christ returns, "He will reward each according to his works." Jesus' confessing or denying a confession and being ashamed are issues of rewards deserved by believers. <br><br>
                                
                                The negative "reward" (from <i>misthos</i>, which can also mean recompense, payment) for those who deny their identification with Christ or are ashamed of Him is that Jesus will not confess (acknowledge) them before the Father, or similarly, will be ashamed of them before the Father. Since this is in the context of (Discipleship), what does this mean? Since Jesus Christ's confession of someone before the Father is an acknowledgment of his or her faithfulness in identifying with Him, the negative of that is Jesus will withhold acknowledgment of that person. He will be ashamed in the sense of refusing to acknowledge him or her with a commendation before the Father. <br><br>
                                
                                That this is a consequence experienced only by Christians makes sense. It is no motivation to an unbeliever who rejects Christ not to be confessed before the Father or for Christ to be ashamed. In light of his decision to have nothing to do with Jesus Christ, what would he or she care? But to those who have a relationship with Jesus Christ, to earn a word of approval or disapproval, or to make Christ ashamed would have a great motivating impact. The believer knows the love of God and the sacrifice Jesus has made for him by dying on the cross. Disapproval and shame assume a degree of relationship. For example, imagine a boy misbehaving in a shopping mall. While others walk by nonplussed, one man's face is flushed with embarrassment and his head is lowered in shame. That is the boy's father. The son disappointed his father's expectations. <br><br>
                                
                                Our Savior's approval or disapproval of our conduct and choices should be a motivation to us who are children of a Heavenly Father. In the end, it is the only approval that really matters. Publicly identifying with Jesus Christ may or may not win approval from others in this world, but either way, the effect is temporary. God's approval is eternal.
